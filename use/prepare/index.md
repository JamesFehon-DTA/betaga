## Understand your obligations within the investment process
If you are bringing forward a digital or ICT-enabled proposal for consideration through the budget process, you need to meet certain requirements under the Whole-of-government digital and ICT investment oversight framework (IOF).
The IOF helps ensure that government’s digital investments are well-planned, aligned with strategic priorities and delivering value for money.

## Understand the mandatory policies that apply to your proposal
There are several whole-of-government policies that apply to all digital and ICT investments. These are mandatory for government agencies depending on:
* whether your agency is a corporate or non-corporate Commonwealth entity
* the total cost of your investment
* the cost of the digital component of your project.
