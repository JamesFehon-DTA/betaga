allowing the australian public sector (aps) to streamline, automate, and effectively manage the complexities associated with travel planning, expense reimbursement, relocation, and financial tracking.tems capability refers to the software and systems designed to manage and optimise the travel and expense management aspects of operating in the australian government’s erp environment. it integrates with several travel and credit related provider systems, to enable aps staff to manage budgets and expenditure related to local and domestic travel and miscellaneous expenses.tems integrates functionalities for: travel booking and authorisation: centralised planning and booking with adherence to policies and budget constraints. expense management: structured submission, validation, approval, and reimbursement, reducing errors and overhead. policy compliance: enforcing adherence to government regulations and transparency requirements. audit and reporting: robust tracking and analysis of expenses, ensuring transparency and accountability. integration with financial systems: facilitating accurate accounting and budgeting. mobile accessibility: enabling convenient management of travel plans and expenses.this standard is limited to the tems sub-capability, and should be viewed within the context of the overarching enterprise resource planning (erp) standard, and alongside those aligned to the other defined erp value streams: erp finance standard erp human capital management (hcm) standard erp procurement standardtravel and expense management (tems) capability can be implemented through several commercial platform solutions. these platforms may be discovered in multiple ways such as: buyict; whole of australian-government contracts; and entity implemented solutions underpinned by platforms.efficient tems capability is crucial for commonwealth entities, optimising travel planning, expense management, and reimbursement processes. through automation and policy enforcement, it boosts operational efficiency, transparency, and oversight. real-time spending insights empower informed decision-making, supported by rigorous audit trails ensuring compliance and accountability. ultimately, it fosters cost-effectiveness and resource optimisation.this capability plays a pivotal role in delivering functionality and value for commonwealth entities by providing a tailored suite of tools and processes, including: efficiency and streamlining: automating travel planning, booking, expense submission, and reimbursement processes reduces manual effort and enhances overall productivity. policy adherence and compliance: embedding government regulations and policies into workflows ensures transparency and accountability in spending. real-time visibility and control: integration with financial systems provides insights into spending data, facilitating informed decision-making and budget utilisation. accuracy and auditability: automated validation processes minimise errors and fraudulent activities, while robust audit trails ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. cost savings and optimisation: streamlined processes and policy enforcement identify opportunities for cost savings and optimisation, maximising value for taxpayers.standard statementsentities should: ensure their erp tems solution

solutions can facilitate the interconnection of commonwealth entity, supplier, and partner functionality needed by government to manage internal and external engagements with stakeholders. internal interoperability via api functionality can increase productivity, efficiency, accuracy, and visibility, and enhance management reporting. external interoperability can provide access to government data and should be governed under a fair use policy, as well as in consideration of guidance aligned to capabilities.use api.gov.au as a central resourceentities must: apply the national api design standards (napids) hosted on api.gov.au to all experience level apis.entities should: apply the napids to all process level apis tailored for re-usability apply the napids to custom developed, system level apis to assist developing process or experience level apis if required utilise api.gov.au as a resource guiding all api development requirements.the standard does not apply to third-party system level apis such as those available ‘out-of-the-box’ or as part of software as a service (saas) platform, e.g. salesforce apis or arcgis apis. however, it may be applicable in circumstances where these experience level apis are re-exposed for wider consumption.understand the evolving api technology environmententities should: prioritise rest (representational state transfer) as the basis for design, noting its ‘core’ position as the de-facto mechanism of data representation and transfer to and from systems on the internet consider emerging alternatives such as graphql for streaming data or function-based apis, where rest apis typically are not suitable avoid implementation of outdated/superseded api types such as soap (simple object access protocol) retire/replace older api types such as soap where they are presently in use monitor emerging trends when developing api solutions.recent shifts in the api architecture and design have included the evolution of api gateways from proprietary, supplier owned and managed interfaces to open-sourced alternatives offered at little or no cost. these offerings reduce implementation cost and provide greater flexibility in interconnecting other apis and systems.api design is evolving to incorporate the segmentation of api data functionality into either control streams or pure data, ensuring the optimisation of data flow through the api. the technology movement in both api domains provide an opportunity for commonwealth entities to enhance interoperability, reduce implementation costs and optimise data transfer functionality. there is also a recent trend towards direct incorporation of machine learning and large language model systems that will be inherently dependent on api connectivity.lower development and maintenance complexityentities should: ensure that their selected solution is supportable, affordable, secure, and fit-for-purpose consider the suitability of low-code / no-code development paths prior to the use of more contemporary api development approaches.api solutions can be implemented using a low-code/no-code development approach that uses human-centred functionality to rapidly define, test, integrate, and present complex processes and rulesets in a modular and repeatable manner, with minimal use of programming languages.contemporary api solutions adopting a low-code / no-code approach can benefit from the removal of layers between an analyst’s expertise and the solution. direct engagement between the analyst and the platform can help optimise the end-to-end process or integrate the needs of a stakeholder. benefits of this approach include rapid development, a better-understood and more refined business process and enhanced stakeholder satisfaction.determine an api release, fair use, and distribution strategyentities must: define and document an api release, fair use and distribution strategy control and document release and distribution on a per-api basis.entities should: ensure a transparent approach to the release of apis, around fair and reasonable use of the api and access to all associated data provide clear guidance on how apis may be made available, including any supply costs.commonwealth entities have invested in the substantial development of system apis. some of these may be used internally as patterns, supplied to other entities for systems interconnection or released externally for third party interfaces. api owners have a discretion as to how, and to whom, they release apis.adhere to reuse principlesthe australian government architecture provides information for entities on reuse.entities must: meet the requirements of the digital and ict reuse policy ensure that their selected solution, irrespective of reuse of existing investment, is supportable, affordable, secure, and fit-for-purpose through continual improvement of processes, and features, data, security, technology, skills, and cost check the contractual arrangements, memorandum of understanding (mou) currency, and aga design state prior to investment.entities should: compare their requirements with those of other comparable entities and system functions, and seek to reuse learnings from preceding implementations consider specific functional and non-functional requirements prior to solution design or consideration of technology choice, including: volume and nature of information assets broader system purpose performance and availability requirements privacy/sensitivity concerns discover existing designs on the aga website,

process and standardisation of outgoing communication from commonwealth entities is important to the entities and recipients alike. while current-state technology and solutions have in some ways enhanced the management of outgoing correspondence, considerations detailed in the standard below will help ensure appropriate and successful correspondence capability implementations across

(dat) act 2002 (cth) disability discrimination act 1992(cth) freedom of information act 1982 (cth) privacy act 1988 (cth) comply with any other legislation applicable to specific functions and circumstances.communicate transparently, and proactivelyentities should: design systems in a manner that automates immediate correspondence at predefined key points, such as when decisions are made, entitlements are granted, and user input is required clearly incorporate all relevant detail in communications include appropriate entity contact details within any messaging.motivate digital-firstentities should: communicate the benefits and demonstrate the ease of use for adopting a digital channel provide gradual transition options easing users into fully digitised outgoing correspondence services prioritise secure digital communication channels above physical media digitally generate correspondence in a standardised, systemised, tested manner integrate automated correspondence generation with core systems, including (but not limited to) those servicing entitlements, case management, customer relationship management, and any other capability supporting administrative decision making where possible, avoid custom integrations of correspondence management tools with other systems, to allow greater maintainability and opportunities for future reuse utilise whole-of-government communication channels such as the mygov inbox unless there is a clear reason not to.write correspondence that is simple, clear, inclusive, and relevantentities must: adhere to the australian government style manual, that sets the criteria for australian government writing and editing align to applicable principles from the digital experience policy, in particular to design and deliver services that are user-friendly, and inclusive, as well as relevant positions from the digital service standard and digital inclusion standard align to the australian government branding guidelines.entities should: produce clear, coherent, and inclusive correspondence that serves the users’ needs define internal, entity-wide mandatory standards, and associated templates, to ensure consistency between different outputs and channels ensure human-centred design practices are applied when writing and managing outbound correspondence ensure cohesion between digital channels and outgoing correspondence ensure that digital communications are validated as being able to be read/interfaced with by accessible technologies.securely identify and communicate to businesses and individualsgovernment correspondence may contain sensitive data, and the risk of inadvertent access or damage must be managed. entities must: identity-verify individuals prior to sending of correspondence through an identity system ensure that each stage of the communication chain, between sender and recipient, meets legislative requirements and security standards such as the protective security policy framework.entities should: utilise an identity system to determine trust between individuals, organisations, services, and devices utilise the trusted digital identity framework identity exchange and attribute provider to enable identity authentication avoid communicating information that could cause the recipient to behave in a way that might be exploited by threat actors.apply ai ethics principles and policy when ai is involved in outgoing correspondenceentities must: comply with the policy for responsible use of ai in government where there is ai involved at any point in outgoing correspondence.entities should: consider opportunities to utilise emerging technologies, such as ai, to speed up the correspondence of critical information to individuals and business apply australia’s 8 artificial intelligence (ai) ethics principles when curating and sending outgoing correspondences for people and businesses using ai ensure ai inclusions are developed and used in a way that provides benefits while minimising the risk of negative impact to people, groups, and wider society transparently identify where and how ai has been utilised at any point of an outgoing correspondence chain.adhere to reuse principlesthe australian government architecture provides information for entities on reuse.entities should: where possible use the mygov inbox for outbound correspondence consider outgoing correspondence-specific functional and non-functional requirements prior to solution design or consideration of technology choice, including: existing

important that they adopt a strategic approach that outlines a clear vision, a plan for incremental development, and a target to pragmatically achieve their organisational objectives.all cloud finops implementations should take a systemic approach, factoring in need of stakeholders including, but not limited to: executive leadership need assurance that the cloud is controlled and managed effectively and efficiently. this can be achieved through regular updates and strategic meetings, as well as through detailed reporting, such as real-time dashboards that provide insights into key performance metrics and operational challenges. finance teams need to identify the budget owners, forecast the costs for each budget owner, and monitor the actual versus predicted costs on a regular basis. product owners need to forecast and track the cloud costs related to their product, and account for those costs within the profit and loss. they need to understand the business changes that can impact their predicted costs, and track value metrics to ensure they are getting an efficient service. it leadership need to ensure that the cloud finops strategy is incorporated into the cloud strategy and ensure an effective cloud finops service. they need to establish optimisation priorities, define technical controls and processes, so that they can track the trends, identifying and responding to any anomalous costs. engineering teams need to be aware of their service costs and have defined routes for the technical optimisation of their services. they need to be alerted to irregular or unplanned costs and either take corrective action or communicate the changes and their value. the running cost needs to be considered as part of the design process when developing or refreshing systems to enable optimum design decisions.the needs of stakeholders should be realised via clear and traceable requirements, that are maintained as fundamental to further implementation works.comply with legislationwhen establishing cloud finops practices, entities should ensure legislative compliance and embed visibility and legislative traceability into the operating model itself. this approach ensures compliance and legislative alignment is core to all cloud deployments and makes audits efficient.any domain-specific legislation relevant to the context of the entity/cloud investment should be considered alongside core pieces of legislation including the: archives act 1983 (cth) data availability and transparency (dat) act 2002 (cth) public governance, performance and accountability act 2013 (cth)research and assess practices and solutionsall entities should conduct their own requirements gathering and follow an objective assessment of platform suitability utilising whole-of-government (wofg) procurement panels, guidance and tool kits.researching and assessing cloud finops solutions is crucial, particularly as this is an emerging capability in which vendor offerings are also rapidly evolving. thorough research allows entities to understand the diverse range of solutions and tools available, helping to make informed decisions to optimise cost management, enhance resource utilisation and compatibility with existing systems.incrementally improve strategiesentities should incrementally establish a central cloud finops function to provide coordination and information between stakeholders involved in cloud operations. making multiple small scale, quick actions with limited scope allows finops teams to assess the outcomes of their actions, and gain insights into the value of taking further action.reuse previous investmententities should seek to reuse existing investment where suitable, and prudentially consider whether the efficacy of a given implementation method will meet entity needs. when selecting a cloud finops model, tool, or platform for reuse, entities should: understand their use-case specific functional and non-functional requirements, including volume and nature of data, broader system purpose, performance matters, and privacy/sensitivity concerns consider existing and future technological landscape and interoperability needs investigate previous investment within your entity and across government and seek to reuse where suitable ensure any investment is contemporary and viable for long-term use.if existing options in the capability are not suitable, consideration should be given to the reusability of relevant processes and practices derived from related aga capabilities.there are several existing governance frameworks developed for other aga capabilities, that may lend themselves to developing cloud finops policies and practices. entities may also explore the finops framework, established by the finops foundation, which provides an operating model that it considers a baseline for establishing excellent finops practice.build for reuse and the long-term usedeveloping a cloud finops system with broad applicability across entities, and a future-focus that enables long term support and viability, is critical for reducing risk, increasing efficiency, and supporting consistent implementation across government.any new system should be designed with a modular and scalable architecture, allowing for future integration into other structures. emphasising interoperability and

process and workflow solutions consolidate one or more business processes, use workflow management or allow the consistent definition and application of rules to make transactions user-centric from beginning to end. they support commonly used functionality needed by government to manage internal and external process and rules management with stakeholders.when implemented well, they can increase productivity, efficiency, accuracy, visibility, and reporting. poor implementation can result in cost and process inefficiencies, duplication of effort, and user dissatisfaction.agency function, such as policy, service delivery, legislative, or regulatory focuses, can be of value in identifying potential options for applications of this capacity and standard to meet aga policy objectives, although

and assurance testing with business owners. incorporate the output from these mapping activities as key business requirements for the proposed platform.check for existing re-useable business process and workflow designs before engaging in new development processesmany digital business process and workflow solutions and platforms exist across government which may be suitable for reuse. these include the development of new instances of existing cloud implementations or the leveraging of existing designs, either entirely or via utilisation of a component or components.agencies should: discover these designs through the aga, through direct contact with agencies with comparable use cases, via existing whole-of-government (wofg) arrangements, or by way of inter-government memorandums of understanding (mou).build for reuseagencies should: provide evidence of the systems investigated when reuse is not feasible, and demonstrate how any new investment can be reused implement a business process and workflow system that meets current and future needs and standards. this system should reduce risk, increase efficiency, and support modular and scalable architecture, allowing for future extension and integration into other agency structures emphasise interoperability and standardisation in technologies and data formats to ensure adaptability across different agencies build

complexity of business process and workflow solutionsbusiness process and workflow solutions can often be implemented through low-code/no-code platform solutions. these solutions use human-centred

management is the process of managing a series of steps or events to reach a resolution. case management systems help track and manage cases from start to finish. the case management systems normally would include the following functionalities: controls on how information is shared and restricted processes for auditing and overseeing workflows the ability to route cases dynamically based on specific needs clear goals and outcomes that are recorded proper collection and assignment of informationbecause different entities have unique case management needs, a single, centralised system or one-size-fits-all approach is not practical. each entity must choose, design and implement a solution that fits its specific requirements.understand alignment to case management archetypesentities should: align their requirements with common government case management archetypes to enable reuse: contract management investigation management service management human resources management complaints management compliance management claims management. develop a comprehensive understanding of requirementsentities should: ensure that systems meet non-functional requirements including: auditability requirements of cases processes and/or outcomes privacy requirements of individuals, organisations, processes, or intellectual property security needs, particularly if the system contains sensitive or personally identifying data or is otherwise likely a target for threat actors availability/redundancy, especially in the case of systems supporting round-the-clock needs such as medical

existing government case management platforms investigate whole-of-government arrangements and memorandums of understanding (mous).build for reuseif an existing system cannot be reused, entities should: provide evidence of evaluations conducted on existing government systems demonstrate how the new system will be scalable, reuseable and interoperable with other government platforms.lower development and maintenance complexity of case management solutionsentities should: minimise the need for extensive programming through modular design facilitate rapid development and testing of new case management processes improve business process understanding and stakeholder satisfaction ensure solutions are supportable, affordable, secure and fit for purpose and consider the suitability of low-code/no-code solutions prior to development or adoption of a platform review contractual arrangements, mou currency and aga designs before selecting a solution.understand the existing technology

term definition commonwealth entity has the same meaning as set out in the public governance, performance and accountability act 2013. the pgpa flipchart is a reference of all non-corporate and corporate commonwealth entities and commonwealth companies. donation generally, a donation is understood as a gift given to a cause or organisation, often charitable, without expecting anything in return. for the purposes of commonwealth entities, donations might be treated similarly to gifts, subject to the same rules and expectations for proper use and management of public resources. end-of-life “end-of-life” in this guide refers to the stage in a device’s life cycle when it is no longer usable or needed for government use, and decisions are made regarding its disposal, recycling, or repurposing. manufacturers end-of-life is when tech companies cease providing software and security updates and the devices are no longer supported. we do not support devices being donated at the end of the manufacturer’s life. gift a gift refers to relevant property that is given to someone without payment. information the pspf defines information as: physical documents/papers, electronic/digital data or intellectual information (knowledge) that is owned, managed or maintained by the entity. it includes details of methodologies, classified military/intelligence activities or operations, diplomatic discussions and negotiations. recycling recycling is the action or process of converting waste into reusable material. relevant property property (other than relevant money) that is owned or held by the commonwealth or a corporate commonwealth entity relevant property in this guide refers to all in scope devices even when its value has depreciated to $0, as section 66 would still apply. reuse reuse can have several definitions. “reuse” in this guide refers to devices are refurbished to be either donated or sold. this gives a second life for the equipment. if devices are unsuitable for reuse, the device can still be recycled for parts. social organisation social organisations are organisations that operate with the primary goal of addressing social issues and improving community well-being. they often work in nonprofit sectors and focus on providing support and services to vulnerable populations. examples include charities, nonprofits, and community groups. reference to social organisation in this guide refers to organisations that facilitate the donation of devices to vulnerable community groups. partner organisations partner organisations are organisations that collaborate with other organisations (like government agencies) to achieve shared goals, particularly in projects requiring expertise or resources that a single entity may lack. partners can be from various sectors, including private companies, nonprofits, and other governmental bodies. they play a crucial role in facilitating the implementation and success of joint initiatives. reference to partner organisation in this guide refers to organisations where agencies have outsourced the sanitisation and cleansing process of devices. files and templates sustainable

schemelast updated: november 2018this guide was last updated in 2018 and should be considered as outdated pending further revision on blockchain capability in 2026. the dta does not currently hold a formal position on the use of blockchain technology.this case study was published to complement the “do you need blockchain?” guide, providing high-level guidance for commonwealth government entities considering the adoption of blockchain technology.the national disability insurance scheme trialled combining blockchain with the new payments platform to create smart money.what problem were you trying to solve?we looked at solving problems with 3 sets of users: for ndis participants, simplifying the user experience by eliminating paperwork, manual calculations, paper receipts and service eligibility considerations. for ndis service providers, reducing administration costs by enabling simple eligibility checks, near real-time payments and automatic reconciliation. for the government, enabling improved value for money through enhanced service delivery and fraud control powered by data analytics capabilities.how did use of a blockchain help solve this problem?the proof of concept translates budgets in participant’s ndis plans into blockchain tokens. smart contracts (which represent the budget rules) are dynamically attached to the blockchain tokens to form smart money (programmed to know who it can be spent by, what it can be spent on and when it can be spent). this enables ndis participants, service providers and the government to have real-time visibility of service eligibility, with appropriate access controls for privacy. furthermore, service providers could redeem the tokens they receive as they deliver services for near real-time payment on australia’s new payments platform.did you consider existing data exchange and centralised database technologies?yes, our report evaluated the proof of concept against a hypothesised centralised database solution. we found that a centralised database and our smart money proof of concept could achieve a similar front-end user experience. while the smart money proof of concept could offer potential platform advantages on the back-end, if the smart money technology was applied across multiple payment environments (that is, to the ndis and other use cases), further work may be required to deliver sufficient performance and confidentiality outcomes to achieve these platform benefits.what brought you to blockchain?cba and csiro’s data61 had wanted to test the potential of blockchain to enable smart money for quite a while. we were also interested to see how blockchain technology may be able to integrate with existing payments technologies, such as australia’s new payments platform. the ndis contains highly personalised budgets and payments, making it a good case study for our project.what went well?the smart money proof of concept could enable all the conditions in the ndis ecosystem, including different types of budget management (self-management, agency-management and plan-management). we received great feedback from ndis participants and carers on our prototype app (net promoter score rating of 89%).what surprised you?one of the biggest surprises was the extent of the challenge to collect all the data required to enable conditional payments across the ndis ecosystem, including payments to general businesses that deliver services to ndis participants (for example, travel, digestive aids). the design challenge is as much about effective data collection as it is about data processing (whether using blockchain or a centralised database).what do you know now that you didn’t know earlier?that blockchain technology offers promise, particularly around the potential for platform benefits if the technology is leveraged across multiple conditional payment environments – but that further work is required to balance 2 key design criteria: performance and confidentiality.what advice would you pass on to other government agencies?collaborate with the digital transformation agency and other government and industry stakeholders related to your use case, so that you can benefit from a range of perspectives and expertise. user research with existing users of government schemes is also invaluable and should be central to your design considerations.access the reportthe commonwealth bank of australia website hosts the making money smart (empowering ndis participants with blockchain technologies) report (full text) and the making

factors are considered before starting a procurement1. buyers consider important digital investment factorswhat does this mean?for information on what each of the digital investment factors means see the digital investment factors appendix.why is this important?considering important digital factors before starting a procurement helps investments meet their intended outcomes. key investment decisions are often made before procurement requirements are drafted. by the time a procurement commences, it may be too late to retrofit elements of the digital investment factors.requirements are designed to allow for a range of solutions to deliver business outcomes1. use outcomes-focused requirementswhat does this mean?the outcome is the result of the work to be performed (the ‘what’) rather than the way it is to be performed (the ‘how’). this means writing requirements based on the desired outcome and the result of the work to be performed. for example, buyers should not seek to procure defined activities, tasks or assets. instead of considering inputs (e.g. resources, time and people), buyers should consider outcomes (e.g. an uplift in capability, more efficient processing of records or a service that more users want to use). at a minimum, buyer requirements could ask for outputs (e.g. a strategy or a hr system). buyers should also use descriptive, not prescriptive language. being descriptive means using language that describes the problem as part of the requirements, rather than prescribing a pre-conceived solution.why is this important?using outcomes-focused requirements reduces the cost of doing business with government. this allows businesses more flexibility when pitching a solution to best solve a problem, rather than trying to meet over-engineered requirements. focusing on desired outcomes and describing them clearly means sellers have more information. this allows sellers to propose solutions that are more likely to achieve that outcome.2. create smaller, focused packages of workwhat does this mean?contracts are designed and broken down into smaller parts of larger projects. buyer should consider using the service design and delivery process as a framework for their investment. this process can help create distinct stages of work, such as discovery, alpha and beta, to deliver a better solution.why is this important?creating smaller packages of work helps ensure businesses of all sizes can offer solutions to government, increasing competition and opportunities for innovation. by reducing vendor lock-in, shorter contracts allows agencies to bring in new and innovative technology earlier.3. make access easy for businesses of all sizeswhat does this mean?clear, high-quality information is provided up front to sellers. this reduces the need to clarify requirements later-on. classifying work with a higher security classification than is required is avoided. over-classifying unfairly advantages incumbents who already hold security clearances or sellers that can wait long periods of time for clearances. remember that having worked with government before cannot be a condition of getting work.why is this important?making access easy for business of all sizes helps create a vibrant ecosystem of sellers that can offer more competitive solutions. this increases innovation and helps buyers to discover more options to meet their business needs.panels that offer a better experience for buyers and sellers are considered (if using a panel)evaluate digital certified panelswhat does this mean?buyers are encouraged to evaluate whether a panel on the list of digital certified panels meets their needs, if a panel is their chosen sourcing mechanism. the list helps them to identify modern and fit for purpose panels. panels are used to buy commonly used, clearly defined products and services. other methods, like open or limited tender, may be more suitable for other products and services.why is this important?digital certified panels offer opportunities to buy the latest technology from panels that are easier to use for government and have better access for sellers. these panels aim to reduce costs, duplication and burden on buyers and sellers.evaluations are set up to be fair to all sellers, enabling buyers to find the best opportunities to meet their needs1. the best value for money is not necessarily the tender which offers the lowest pricewhat does this mean?when evaluating proposals from sellers, buyers consider the whole-of-life cost of their investment. whole-of-life cost includes, but is not limited to, the initial purchase price of a solution, maintenance costs, transition out costs, licensing costs (where applicable), the cost of additional features added after the initial investment, consumable costs and disposal costs.why is this important?a low initial cost does not necessarily mean a solution will represent value for money over its life. whole-of-life cost is a key component of assessing value for money. costs incurred after the initial purchase could mean a solution with a low initial cost ends up having a high whole-of-life cost.2. do not unfairly advantage or disadvantage any tenderer. all tenderers should be afforded equal opportunity.what does this mean?some things to consider to afford all tenderers an equal opportunity are: encouraging buyers to consider the agency’s risk profile when evaluating proposals and applying it appropriately when designing contracts. for example, buyers may not need to include unlimited liability as a standard requirement for all their contracts. remember that unlimited liability increases cost and negatively affects all sellers, especially smaller sellers. not using evaluation criteria that includes a requirement for sellers to have government experience. remember that having government experience cannot be a condition of getting work.why is this important?fairness in government digital sourcing is closely related to the notion of effective competition. an ideal state of fairness would mean equal access to opportunities for all sellers regardless of their size. the commonwealth procurement rules, the public governance performance and accountability act 2013 and the indigenous procurement policy include components or measures to achieve fairness.3. ensure there is no bias or favouritism, declare and manage conflicts of interest.what does this mean?examples of incorporating these elements when setting up evaluations include: establishing a conflict of interest registry within the agency. providing training to staff to enable them to identify and manage any issues of bias, favouritism or conflicts of interest.why is this important?bias, favouritism and conflicts of interest can be unintentionally created in government procurement. for example, an incumbent seller may have the benefit of insights other sellers do not. in this context, it is important to explore ways to improve the imbalance between sellers who already have access and new sellers seeking access to an opportunity.4. maintain clear and transparent records to inform feedback to sellerswhat does this mean?maintaining clear and transparent records from the start. buyers capture the right information from their evaluations to provide feedback to sellers and keep track of their processes and decisions. buyers use this information to inform their feedback to sellers.why is this important?maintaining clear and transparent records will provide valuable evidence when providing feedback in the future to sellers. providing useful feedback to sellers will help all agencies to maintain a more engaged, informed and competitive pool of sellers.procurement processes are streamlined to minimise burden and attract sellerssimplify and streamline procurement processeswhat does this mean?detailed examples of how to simplify and streamline procurement processes are listed under the corresponding ‘how can i implement this standard’ section of the standards for digital sourcing.why is this important?streamlining procurement processes will greatly reduce administrative burden on buyers and sellers. it will do this by reducing the time, effort, cost and resources that are expended by all parties in a procurement process. onerous, complex and lengthy processes also negatively impact competition and value for money across government procurement. remember that all sellers have difficulty absorbing the cost of procurement and that the smaller the seller, the greater the impact. buyers also increase their risk of buying old technology if your procurement is protracted.sellers are provided useful feedback that helps them improveprovide useful feedback on a request for debriefwhat does this mean?following a request for a debriefing, buyers give feedback to the seller against the broad range of areas and criteria considered in their evaluation process. buyers consider the relevant financial and non-financial costs and benefits when providing feedback. this includes, but is not limited to, the value for money elements outlined in the commonwealth procurement rules. it may be beneficial to have a template that provides feedback against these elements.why is this important?providing regular and useful feedback helps sellers improve, creating a more competitive market, driving better value for money and encouraging a diverse range of products and services.aga code: des75type: designlinked to:

(dta) and the department of industry, science and resources (disr) released initial interim guidance on government use of publicly available generative artificial intelligence (ai) platforms.this guidance will be iterative, with updates currently being considered. it is provided for government agencies to implement within their organisation. aps staff should follow their agency’s policies and guidance on using generative ai tools in the first instance.feedback from public consultation on the responsible use of ai in australia will be used to inform consideration across government on appropriate regulatory and policy responses that may include future iterations of this guidance.click here to see the current guidance. for previous versions of this guidance, see the change log table below.introduction for agenciesgenerative ai presents new and innovative opportunities for government and an increasing number of tools and models are now easily available to use.however, due to their rapid evolution and uptake, there is an urgent need and growing demand for guidance to support the consideration and assessment of the risks involved in their use.whole-of-government and agency-specific policies provide guidance on ensuring the appropriate, safe and effective use of technology tools, including ai. however, given the ease of access and use with publicly available generative ai tools like chatgpt, microsoft copilot and google bard, this interim guidance is recommended for government agencies to use as the basis for providing advice to their staff. it is also recommended as the basis for advice in relation to the enterprise version of microsoft copilot (previously referred to as bing chat enterprise), where agencies have enabled it for staff use.in addition to the interim guidance for staff, we recommend agencies: consider implementing an enrolment mechanism to register and approve staff user accounts to access public generative ai platforms. this could include appropriate approval processes through relevant senior accountable officers (e.g. chief information security officer (ciso) or chief information officer (cio)). implement an internal feedback/reporting mechanism to evaluate any challenges staff are facing in following guidance. seek to move to commercial arrangements for generative ai solutions as soon as it is possible.in exploring commercial arrangements for generative ai solutions, agencies should consider whether service providers and their ai services have undergone a security assessment by an infosec registered assessor program (irap) assessor to determine their security posture and security risks associated with their use. this assurance may better enable agencies to leverage the benefits of generative ai solutions while meeting their data security and privacy requirements. otherwise, agencies should apply the guidance under ‘privacy protection and security’ as the default advice for the level of classification/sensitivity of information that may be entered into generative ai solutions.agencies may also consider developing or using in-house ai models that do not rely on sending data to an external ai service provider.while the default position of this guidance continues to be a recommendation that staff use work email addresses instead of personal email addresses where it is necessary to log in to public generative ai tools, it is up to each agency to consider how it appropriately applies the guidance. using work email addresses provides staff with a clearer separation between work and personal use of these tools. a range of obligations apply to actions undertaken by australian public service (aps) staff in connection with their employment, including those outlined under the aps values, employment principles and code of conduct.as the government’s understanding of the legislative, administrative and broader risks of this technology evolves, the dta, in collaboration with disr, will investigate the development of whole-of-government policies and frameworks relating to the responsible use of ai in government.in the meantime, we encourage agencies to build on this interim guidance and implement agency-level policies. the interim guidance will be updated as needed to provide the latest advice on how to approach generative ai.we also invite agencies to provide feedback on the value, applicability or relevance of this guidance by emailing digitalpolicy@dta.gov.au. version date status notes 2.0 22/11/2023 current this update: * updates the introduction for agencies section with additional discussion on commercial and in-house generative ai tools and clarifies the reporting recommendation as relating to an internal agency feedback/reporting mechanism * restructures the guidance to align more closely with australia’s ai ethics principles including the addition of new sections on human, societal and environmental wellbeing &amp; fairness and human-centred values * removes figure 1 (initial high-risk assessment) due to feedback about clarity and consistency * includes additional guidance under the

of ai in government took effect. this supersedes the below guidance, which is retired effective that same date.adoption of ai in the public sectorby 2030, it is estimated that artificial intelligence (ai) and associated machine-assisted decision-making technologies will contribute more than $20 trillion dollars to the global economy. ai can present many benefits to government and users of their services. for example, ai can be used to manage resources, improve efficiencies, and enhance public services. the use of ai, however, comes with unique risks and challenges for government agencies. mitigating these risks and challenges is possible and will allow agencies to recognise these benefits.the term ‘ai’ is often used interchangeably to describe several technologies within ai that are used in machine-assisted decision-making applications including machine learning, robotic process automation (rpa), natural language programming, deep learning (neural networks), computer vision and robotics.ai systems embrace a family of technologies that can bring together computing power, scalability, networking, connected devices and interfaces, and data.these systems can be programmed to perform specific tasks such as reasoning, planning, natural language processing, computer vision, audio processing, interaction, prediction and more. with machine learning, ai systems can improve on tasks over time according to a set of human-defined objectives and can operate with varying levels of autonomy.despite the potential for achieving better efficiencies through incorporating machine assistance into decision-making, application to government decisions, such as regulatory or service delivery, should strongly consider the potential impacts of adverse outcomes that can impact individuals and business.current usage in the apsai is currently available in several commercial products used across commonwealth agencies. agencies looking to adopt established technologies which use ai still have an obligation to manage the benefits and risks associated with the use of that technology. agencies should also pay particular attention to the governance and ethical implications of adoption and application of the ai system. usage must also be authorised by law, particularly where discretion is used to determine outcome.ai capabilities are currently being used in solutions in several agencies including: chatbots, virtual assistants and agents in service management document and image detection and recognition for border control and fraud detection data mapping to geographical areas free text recognition and translation entitlement calculation natural language processing.these applications represent various levels of risk both to the reputation of the agency, as well as individuals or business impacted by the decisions made or informed by the technology. commonwealth entities looking to use ai systems in these areas should pay particular attention to the governance, risk, ethical, and legal implications of adoption and application of ai system.ai initiatives across the commonwealththe critical nature of ai and potential benefits to government has triggered a range of ai related initiatives and investigations happening throughout the commonwealth. the dta’s work on better structure and guidance for ai adoption in the public sector seeks to complement the broader whole of economy ai focuses on supporting australian industries more generally. both elements will continue to evolve as other longer-term ai specific initiatives underway across the commonwealth progress over time.some of these initiatives include: the artificial intelligence for decision making initiative the automated decision making and ai regulation whitepaper the review of the privacy act 1998 the royal commission into the robodebt scheme.objectivethe whole of government focus of this section is targeted specifically towards providing better structure to close the current gap in practical guidance within government, for translating existing ai principles into practice. the information is intended to increase confidence to uptake ai in australian government agencies, through clarity on informing appropriate design, build and usage of ai technologies.it is critical that, as the public sector embraces these objectives, it is also recognised that with the opportunities that ai presents comes risk. ai is not infallible, and data inefficiencies and biases built into ai algorithms risk causing unintended harm at scale if they are not addressed and mitigated against. this standard should be consumed by entities considering ai to ensure that australians are better able to trust that the technology will be used responsibly and safely by the australian government, and that ai promotes and improves inclusivity. it will be updated as necessary to ensure it remains consistent with the complementary commonwealth-led workstreams, policies and legislation.audiencethe primary audience for this information is members of the australian public service who are engaged with the outputs of ai technologies to either inform activities or decisions, responsible for business processes or policy outcomes that are supported by ai technologies, responsible for decisions relating to the usage of ai technologies within an agency or who operate directly or indirectly in the technologies, for example: agency heads senior executives, decision makers and influencers who are responsible for the outcomes of policy decisions informed or assisted by ai technologies senior executives, decision makers and influencers who are responsible for the design and use of ai systems project leads and teams considering ai applications in their solutions operational leads and teams managing ai systems.this information can also be used by private sector stakeholders to better understand the expectations and requirements of public sector usage of ai technologies.public sector adoption of aigovernanceappropriate governance structures are critical to achieving the ethical and responsible use of ai in a public sector context. governance encompasses the system by which an organisation is controlled and operates, and the mechanisms by which it, and its people, are held to account. ethics, risk management, compliance and administration, including meeting legal requirements, are all elements of governance.initial considerationsbefore adopting ai into a business process, agencies should consider: how the ai system will augment, change or even improve on existing approaches to delivering agency and whole of government outcomes whether ai is the most appropriate solution and if other non-ai and existing systems and processes could be explored.decision-making and accountability hierarchiesexisting business owners and accountable decision makers, as opposed to information technology specialists, remain responsible for decisions assisted by machines and must understand both the inputs for the technologies within a process, and the outputs of the technologies within a process.for this reason, oversight of the development and maintenance of ai technologies must be incorporated into existing decision-making and accountability hierarchies that govern the output, risk and compliance elements of a commonwealth entity’s core business, such as audit and risk committees, and not solely into ict-specific governance arrangements.governance bodies for ai technologies must have a reporting avenue to the secretary, agency head or appropriate agency leadership body to review and accept the usage of these technologies and the way in which they support decision-making. accordingly, these positions must have sufficient understanding of the way in which the technologies operate to inform that decision.further, operational-level implementation should be driven by business or policy areas and supported by technologists, rather than being driven by the ict areas of an entity. this is to ensure that the technology is implemented and maintained to support business and policy outcomes, as opposed to business and policy outcomes being driven by ai systems adoption.agencies should also consider specific functions to support existing governance structures, including in specialist areas such as ai ethics, regulatory compliance and legal advice. these functions require a skill set that allows for consideration of the ramifications of a wide range of issues and must be positioned and at the appropriate level within an organisation to assert the level of influence required to inform decisions on the adoption, usage, review and maintenance of the technologies. expertise within agencies that have mature ai applications presents an avenue to support knowledge transfer across the australian public service (aps). such knowledge transfer could occur, for example, as part of the digital profession.risk managementrisk tolerances must be determined for each specific use case for ai technologies and align with existing risk management frameworks within each agency. in assessing and managing risk associated with the adoption of the technologies, consideration should be given to assessing the varying risk tolerances across each specific use case, rather than in general terms for usage of the technology itself. these tolerances include for example, factors that are specific for each use case and should be considered independently of any prior adoption, such as requirements for accuracy, level of impact to existing process and potential impact to both internal and external outcomes. to achieve appropriate risk management, agencies should consider: how the appropriate human intervention points are to be embedded into the decision-making process; these intervention points will depend on the risk level, as well as the type of decision being aided by the ai, for example ensuring a human decision point in the process preceding any potential negative determination for a citizen or business an appropriate accountability structure to ensure the ongoing compliance of the use case with ethical and responsible ai usage; use cases must also meet existing legal requirements, particularly administrative law principles, privacy law and anti-discrimination law broader reputational risks that apply to public trust in government services; further information on this aspect is described in the australian data strategythe use of risk management frameworksthe differences in risk tolerances for each use case and application of ai technologies inhibits the ability to adopt a universal risk management framework. agencies should use risk management frameworks that are appropriate for the specific use cases and aligned to existing risk management approaches to assess and manage risks specific to ai systems. several publicly available risk frameworks provide examples of how different applications can call for different approaches to risk management, for example: the nsw ai assurance framework is designed to assist agencies to design, build and use ai-enabled products and solutions. it is designed to help agencies identify risks that may be associated with their projects. new zealand has the algorithmic charter for aotearoa new zealand that provides charter signatories with a risk matrix to make an assessment of their algorithm decisions. this supports their evaluation, by quantifying the likelihood of an unintended adverse outcomes against its relative level of impact to derive an overall level of risk. canada has the directive on automated decision making, that imposes a number of requirements, primarily related to risk management, on the federal government’s use of automated decision systems. this directive is targeted at instances where artificial intelligence is used to make, or assist in making, administrative decisions. agencies might also their own risk management frameworks and processes which meet agency specific requirements. however, agencies will need to ensure that these risk management frameworks and processes encompass ai specific risks and governance issues.considerations for the ethical adoption of ai technologiesat a whole of economy level, australia’s ai ethics principles released in 2019 are designed to ensure ai is safe, secure and reliable, as part of australia’s broader ai ethics framework. it was developed alongside several existing and emerging initiatives, including the oecd principles on ai which were endorsed by 42 countries, including australia, and adopted by the g20. australia’s eight ai ethics principles were codeveloped by csiro’s data61 and the department of industry, science and energy (disr), and help to: achieve safer, more reliable and fairer outcomes for all australians reduce the risk of negative impact on those affected by ai applications businesses and governments to practice the highest ethical standards when designing, developing and implementing ai.the implementation of the ai ethics principles is a direct measure under the australia’s ai action plan for making australia a global leader in responsible and inclusive ai. the below guidance has been developed to assist agencies in the key considerations for applying these principles in a public sector context.there are eight ethics principles: human societal and environmental wellbeing human-centred values fairness privacy protection and security reliability and safety transparency and explainability contestability accountability.they help to: achieve safer, more reliable and fairer outcomes for all australians reduce the risk of negative impact on those affected by ai applications businesses and governments to practice the highest ethical standards when designing, developing and implementing ai.this section builds on the ai ethics principles and their application in a public sector context.human, societal and environmental wellbeingai systems should benefit individuals, society and the environment. to incorporate human, societal and environmental wellbeing into the usage of ai technologies, agencies should: document a clear objective and reasonable justification for using ai technology determine that the development and use of ai delivers a clear public benefit and added value to the public consider whether the unintended consequences, secondary harms or benefits, and long-term impacts to the community have been documented; unintended consequences, secondary harm, and long-term negative impacts should be mitigated and prevented where possible conduct a risk assessment of potential risks against positive outcomes, which should be documented consider how the structures will be implemented to ensure than humans are able to maintain visibility of unintended consequences during design, implementation, and ongoing maintenance of the technologies.human-centred valuesai systems should respect human rights, diversity, and the autonomy of individuals. to incorporate human-centred values into the usage of ai technologies, agencies should consider: how the system may prevent the restriction of human rights, and how any impacts to human rights will be measured and mitigated how unlawful discrimination will be prevented. under australia’s federal anti-discrimination laws, it is unlawful to discriminate on the basis of a number of protected attributes, including age, disability, race, sex, intersex status, gender identity and sexual orientation. unlawful discrimination could arise from how algorithms are written, from the use of non-diverse datasets in machine learning and from accessibility discrimination or digital exclusion. australia’s anti-discrimination law (attorney-general’s department) and the human rights public sector guidance sheets (attorney-general’s department) provide additional information regarding discrimination. how user needs and their context for using a service will be understood and designed for as outlined in the digital service standard (digital transformation agency). the inclusion of subject matter experts who understand the ethical and legal implications of the decision or outcome in the design, audit and maintenance of ai applications how disability discrimination (attorney general’s department and the australian human rights commission) will be addressed, and the use of assistive technology to assist people with hearing, visual and other impairments to engage with the ai systems. it is worth noting that failing to provide a reasonable adjustment to enable a person with a disability to engage with ai may constitute unlawful discrimination under federal law how to incorporate diversity throughout designing, developing and deploying ai to minimise the risk of missing important consideration, including how disability discrimination will be addressed.fairnessai systems should be inclusive and accessible and should not involve or result in unfair discrimination against individuals, communities, or groups. to incorporate fairness into the usage of ai technologies, agencies should consider: ensuring that ai is accessible to those who need to use it engaging with people, communities and groups who will be impacted by the ai taking measures to ensure ai produced decisions minimise the risk of harmful bias and discrimination regularly evaluate the impacts of ai, iterating the technology and system to address any negative impacts reading the commonwealth ombudsman’s automated decision-making better practice guide, which provides a practical tool for agencies and includes a checklist designed to assist managers and project officers during the design and implementation of new automated systems in administrative decision-making, and with ongoing assurance processes once a system is operational, will be incorporated into design and maintenance of ai enabled systems. the availability and assurance that data is of appropriate quality to support fair decisions that data governance and management practices ensure data is accurate, timely, complete, and consistent that data supporting ai technologies is fit for purpose, particularly noting usage of data collected for different purposes, and the reflection of biases in historical practices that risk being inherently ‘taught’ through machine learning. how human oversight in the decision-making process will be maintained the appropriate performance measures to calibrate the system.privacy protection and securityai systems should respect and uphold privacy rights and data protection and ensure the security of data to incorporate privacy protection and security into the usage of ai technologies, agencies should consider: how the application of ai technologies aligns with existing legal requirements that currently apply to government decision-making. these legal and policy requirements may include: privacy act 1988 (cth). australian government agencies subject to the privacy act 1988 are required to conduct a privacy impact assessment (pia) for all ‘high privacy risk projects’ under the privacy (australian government agencies – governance) app code 2017. data availability and transparency act 2022 (cth) protective security policy framework (pspf) where applicable, appropriate management of notifiable data breaches under part iiic of the privacy act 1988 ensuring that appropriate security measures are in place to manage potential security vulnerabilities ensuring that ai systems have the appropriate cyber security measures in place and are resilient against cyber-attacks. how the compounded risks associated with ai and the storage of cumulative data will be assessed, documented, and agreed by the appropriate decision maker within an agency whether they have obligations under the freedom of information act 1982 (cth) (foi act) relating to proactive publication of information in accordance with the information publication scheme. it is also considered best practice to publish information about automation, as this is in line with the objectives of the foi act and helps foster public trust in government data-handling. how decision makers will agree to an appropriate risk of theft and exposure of data in ai applicationsreliability and safetyai systems should reliably operate in accordance with their intended purpose. to incorporate reliability into the usage of ai technologies, agencies should consider: the methods of monitoring to recognise and remediate degradation in ai system performance over time, including through the use of a traceability matrix identifying performance metrics to complying with the agreed standard for the technology application the intended use of ai technology is operating in accordance with relevant federal, state or territory legislation undertaking regular monitoring and testing to check ai technologies and systems are meeting their intended purpose; and completing appropriate testing in line with standards and laws to ensure the system is safe.transparency and explainabilitya good administrative apparatus is important for government agencies. to incorporate explainability into the usage of ai technologies, agencies should consider: the way in which meaningful information will be provided about the ai application, which: fosters a general understanding of the ai system with a clear rationale for the decision-making process. is communicated in a way that is easily understood. makes people aware of their interactions with ai systems; and enables those affected by ai systems to understand the outcome and the machine-assisted contributions supporting the outcome. how digital and ict sourcing processes will be best used to ensure understanding of the inner workings of industry products and services how the purpose, operation, and contribution of ai to an overall process will be articulated in clear and understandable language to non-technical audiences, by: being transparent by letting people know, where appropriate, that their personal information is being used for or that they are interacting with an ai system clearly explaining how a decision was informed or aided by ai within what is technically possible. where lawful or legitimate restrictions do not prevent this, this may include: documentation describing the purpose and broad functionality of the ai and how it is used making information about data and ai processes available. the approach to ensure that all technical and policy staff have appropriate support and training to create and maintain the technology application and understand the impact of its change on the overall processes it supports. the tools that will be used to provide meaningful information about the ai applications, including, for example: releasing to the public a risk analysis or profile of all ai machine-assisted decision-making systems creating evidence trails and or checklist of ai decisions creating a decisions register, which may be accessed by a member of the public through a freedom of information request. contestabilitywhen an ai system significantly impacts a person, community, group or environment, there should be a timely process to allow people to challenge the use or outcomes of the ai system. to incorporate contestability into the usage of ai technologies, agencies should consider: the avenues and pathways for an individual or community to contest a decision, including the underlying data and process, including how a decision supported by the technologies can be appealed have communication channels and processes in place that allow users and stakeholders to provide feedback on ai systems the avenues to correct and record errors in decision-making by the ai application, and how best to communicate the avenues of redress to impacted individuals the extent to which information about the underlying technology applications, and algorithms, be made available to the public and other stakeholders structures for updating existing review processes and procedures to ensure their adequacy for the inclusion of ai technologies and assisted machine-assisted decision-making.agencies should also make their own assessment as to whether they have obligations under the freedom of information act 1982 (cth) (foi act) relating to proactive publication of information in accordance with the information publication scheme. it is also considered best practice to publish information about automation, as this is in line with the objectives of the foi act and helps foster public trust in government data-handling.accountabilitypeople responsible for the different phases of the ai system lifecycle should be identifiable and accountable for the outcomes of the ai systems, and human oversight of ai systems should be enabled. to incorporate accountability into the usage of ai technologies, agencies should: consider how ai responsibilities will be included in agency accountability instruments and delegations. consider how delegates and senior executives accountable for decisions informed by ai will have the necessary skills to consider ethics in the decision-making process. ensure accurate and complete documentation and processes for the ai systems and their outcomes are available for external reviews and assurance engagements if necessary, and; have an appropriate level of human oversight for ai and decisions to protect the public.further reading automated decision-making better practice guide (the commonwealth ombudsman) provides a practical tool for agencies and includes a checklist

adoption of blockchain technology.the australian taxation office ran a hackathon to increase transparency around luxury car tax compliance and used blockchain to validate the dealer history of cars.what problem were you trying to solve?we ran a hackathon to see if we could create a prototype to help increase transparency around lct (luxury car tax) compliance and assist other government authorities and car dealerships in helping in tracking vehicle ownership details.how did use of a blockchain help solve this problem?blockchain was used to ensure data entered by car dealers was not later tampered with. also we used it as a shared data-store so that car dealerships, state road authorities and customs can track ownership of a luxury vehicle throughout its lifespan.did you consider existing data exchange and centralised database technologies?it is likely a centralised database may have achieved the desired technology properties in conjunction with the use of hash trees, though the experiment was intended to help us better understand blockchain technology.what brought you to blockchain?blockchain was originally brought to our attention from external hype generated within the it vendor community. in 2018, we were offered an opportunity to engage in an experiment facilitated by microsoft, alongside australian securities and investment commission (asic) and the digital transformation agency (dta), to participate in a blockchain development hackathon.what went well?in one week we built a prototype blockchain solution. the solution worked and proved to be a useful

digital transformation agencylast updated: 12 february 2019this guide was last updated in 2019 and should be considered as outdated pending further revision on blockchain capability in 2026. the dta does not currently hold a formal position on the use of blockchain technology.the “do you need blockchain?” guide provided high-level guidance for commonwealth government entities considering the adoption of blockchain technology.how to decide whether you should invest in blockchain.we based these questions on a blockchain decision tree developed by the us department of homeland security and published by the national institute for standards and technology (nist). we’ve made changes to suit an australian government context, and included some information about public and private blockchains.do you have multiple peers who need to share and write to the same data store?for example, an agency is assessing the merit of a common data store for supply chain data. customs authorities, shipping companies and freight forwarders all use this data.blockchain requires more than two peers who need to share and write to the same database. if your use case doesn’t have this requirement, it is worth considering a conventional database.once you write your records, are they never updated or deleted?for example, an agency may record a transaction against the incorrect welfare participant in a blockchain. this error could only be fixed by appending another, correct record, rather than updating or deleting the original and incorrect record.if you need to update or delete, rather than add to, records, such as a requirement to delete personal information, conventional databases are probably a better solution, however there are options using append-only data storage.will you add sensitive identifiers to the data store?blockchain data is open by default. even if the blockchain has a set of permissioned users, sensitive records, such as medical records, could be at risk. while a person’s identity may not be attached, given the immutability of blockchain, unique data patterns and attributes could, in time, disclose their identity.using blockchains for sensitive or in-confidence data presents risks for public sector agencies that require careful considerations. although some permissioned blockchain protocols allow a concept known as channels to restrict access to specific groups, encrypted databases with secure data exchange are well understood and offer a less risky approach.is it difficult for network peers to decide who should control the data store?for example, it may be hard for a group of nations to decide who should house a centralised data store for sensitive nuclear accounting data.if there is a clear lead organisation or peer who is trusted to control the data store and able to settle disputes and maintain the rules of the network, a conventional database may be a better solution.if agencies can implement appropriate governance arrangements, including the need to mediate disputes and the implications of the control of blockchain, then a blockchain solution may be viable.note: in many instances a blockchain requires a single entity or a formal governance arrangement to control and administer the network. this may remove any benefits from data decentralisation.do you want a tamper-evident log of all writes to the data store?for example, the australian government may benefit from the ability to prove, through audit, that historical scientific records have not been altered.blockchains, just like append-only logs used by entities such as certificate transparency logs, keep a record of all changes to the data. this provides for greater data integrity, but this benefit should be considered against the other requirements of the solution.is there a benefit from removing intermediaries?for example, cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, rely on the permissionless blockchain protocol to facilitate exchange of money without needing a bank. such protocols typically use consensus models, such as ‘proof of work’, to remove the need for an intermediary. this is known as a ‘disintermediation benefit’.undertaking a proof-of-concept can help uncover possible disintermediation benefits for your use case. on the other hand, if removing intermediaries would prevent your organisation from exercising its statutory authority, then conventional data storage may be more appropriate.public blockchaina public blockchain allows anyone to interact with the network. by design, these blockchains are decentralised, giving authority to anyone who can demonstrate effective control over the networks.as a result, when implementing public blockchains, you are effectively providing a permissionless and publicly accessible data publishing and storage solution, with no control over the data once published.you should also consider that many of the blockchain operators may reside outside of australia’s jurisdiction and are anonymous, which may lead to increased data privacy and security risks.if agencies can demonstrate a requirement to prove published data has not been altered, then the concepts of hashing, merkle trees and widely witnessed media can be used to prove data integrity. these technologies and concepts form the basis of blockchain.when considering publishing of datasets for public use, we recommend the use of data.gov.au.private blockchainif you meet all of the criteria above, you might consider a private, or permissioned, blockchain. this kind of blockchain restricts actions to certain participants.if you do not meet all the criteria, then blockchain may not be the best solution to the problem you’re trying to solve.generally, if you can satisfy your use case with a conventional centralised data architecture, such as a database or other mature technology, this may be a more attractive option and be faster to implement.however, it may be valuable for agencies to test smaller-scale uses of blockchain to determine its effectiveness for their particular use case.further considerations for potential blockchain deployments be clear on the governance model of your solution, as centralised governance and control may negate blockchain’s benefits. tackle data standardisation early. the biggest challenge when implementing a blockchain solution or any other data sharing solution is aligning and normalising multiple, historically independent datasets, but this also provides the most benefit. be transparent about your motives. understand the incentives of each party in the network in the short and long terms. it is crucial to understand the role of trust in a blockchain solution.further readingdo you need a blockchain? by karl wust (eth zurich) and arthur gervais (imperial college london) is a technical assessment of blockchain technology. it is a good starting point for technical professionals and academics.we have

2019this guide was last updated in 2019 and should be considered as outdated, pending further revision on blockchain capability in 2026. the dta does not currently hold a formal position on the use of blockchain technology.the blockchain overview: australian government guide provided high-level guidance for commonwealth government entities considering the adoption of blockchain technology.we’ve written this reader’s guide for australian government executives who operate directly or indirectly in technology roles. as part of the guide, we have referenced research carried out by the national institute of standards and technology (nist), which is part of the department of commerce in the united states.our research into blockchain supports the findings of the blockchain technology overview, published by the us government’s national institute of standards and technology (nist). rather than duplicate the nist publication, we have developed the guidance below to help interested government organisations localise nist’s advice for the australian context.in australia, the conversation around blockchain tends to promote its short-term potential, reflecting nist’s observation that:“… the technology is not well understood. it is not magical; it will not solve all problems. as with all new technology, there is a tendency to want to apply it to every sector in every way imaginable.” (p. iv)it is also common for blockchain’s advocates to overlook its limitations, especially around important questions of governance:“…there are operational and governance issues that affect the behavior of the network. for example, in permissioned blockchain networks… there are design issues surrounding what entity or entities will operate and govern the network for the intended user base.” (p. v)blockchain is only one of a number of data storage and exchange solutions, and other proven alternatives are ready for immediate use. depending on the business needs, using more mature solutions allows agencies to move beyond the experimentation or prototyping to real-world applications.we recommend agencies focus on the problem they are facing before applying any solution, including blockchain:blockchain technology is still new and should be investigated with the mindset of “how could blockchain technology potentially benefit us?” rather than “how can we make our problem fit into the blockchain technology paradigm?”. organisations should treat blockchain technology like they would any other technological solution at their disposal and use it in appropriate situations. (p. vi)governance and ownershipagencies must understand the governance arrangements of any proposed blockchain.there are additional risks and considerations when using permissioned consortium blockchains, where leading users often in effect control the blockchain. this usually removes the perceived benefits of decentralisation.“the governance of blockchain networks deals with the rules, practices and processes by which the blockchain network is directed and controlled. a common misconception is that blockchain networks are systems without control and ownership. the phrase “no one controls a blockchain!” is often exclaimed.” (p. 35)“for permissioned blockchain networks, control and governance is driven by members of the associated owner or consortium. the consortium can govern who can join the network, when members are removed from the network, coding guidelines for smart contracts, etc.” (p. 35)trustwhile agencies may find blockchain’s claimed ability to exchange data with low-trust external organisations attractive, it is important to remember that it is not a “trustless” system. users still need to trust the technology itself, the software developers, the dispute mediation process, and the behaviour of other users. should that trust be misplaced, there is little recourse for agencies trying to use blockchain to create new and innovative solutions to problems.another common misinterpretation comes from people hearing that there is no “trusted third party” in a blockchain and assuming blockchain networks are “trustless” environments. while there is no trusted third party certifying transactions in permissionless blockchain networks (in permissioned systems it is less clear, as administrators of those systems act as an administrator of trust by granting users admission and permissions), there is still a great deal of trust needed to work within a blockchain network. (p. 38)encryption and accessagencies should pay particular consideration to the blockchain’s use of encryption. blockchains are not encrypted by default and the data is available to all users, whether users within the network – in the case of private blockchains, or the broader public – for public blockchains. there are permissioned blockchains which can restrict some access, however conventionally speaking, data is not encrypted by default.correcting errorsblockchains are by definition append-only. this means users can only add data to the blockchain, not edit or delete existing data. this makes it impossible to completely erase incorrect data, in the way a database record can be changed or deleted.this may cause significant issues, for example, if sensitive personal details are misrecorded against the wrong person or if the need arises to delete someone’s personal details.consider scenarios where data may be governed by policy or regulations (such as personally identifiable information (pii) or general data protection regulation (gdpr) regulations). data such as this may or may not be appropriate to store even within a permissioned blockchain network. (p. 44)agencies must consider how their processes and procedures can account for this new way of thinking: when it comes to blockchain implementations, mistakes, and their corrections, no matter how small or large, become available to all users with access. while in some cases this may be acceptable or even desirable, agencies must consider the possible risk to trust and agency reputation with this approach.conclusion the dta believes blockchain is still an emerging technology and agencies should be pragmatic when assessing its applications. the dta supports agencies in finding new and innovative responses to challenges and blockchain may be part of future solutions. agencies should objectively compare blockchain solutions to alternative technologies when solving business problems. the limitations of blockchain should be carefully weighed against any unique benefits provided by a blockchain-specific solution for government. agencies should focus on the problems they need to solve, rather than start from a specific technology solution. agencies should continue to monitor blockchain developments, looking for opportunities to enhance service delivery that this technology may unlock in the future.further readingblockchain technology overview (nist)this paper provides strategic advice for executives who are increasingly expected to have a position on what blockchain may

learning management successfactors performance and goals successfactors integration centersap successfactors cannot be ‘picked up’ and used as a tier 1 reuse product in isolation. this is due to current configuration reliance on s/4hana and sap sovereign cloud. the product cannot be componentised and deployed without some build effort. however, sap successfactors blueprints/patterns can be reused in their current state once requirements and implementation planning has been undertaken by interested entities.given the sap successfactors build’s reliance on other sap product suite for operation, sap recommends logical module groupings that can be deployed in phased approach(s): ec (core), ecp &amp; time tracking recruitment and onboarding performance &amp; goals and learning

investigations standard (agis) establishes a standard for australian government entities conducting administrative, civil, or criminal (type) investigations.where agis is in conflict with any applicable law, the legislative requirement will prevail.agis may apply in full or in part to types and stages of investigations. entities must consider which investigations have different standards of proof, procedures and investigation requirements.an investigation can be broadly described as an activity to collect information or evidence to a particular standard of proof related to an alleged, apparent or suspected breach. an investigation gathers information across a broad spectrum to assist entities to determine a course of action, which may also be preventative and/ or disruptive action instead of prosecutorial.the agis does not encompass standards for intelligence and compliance functions (including early intervention). the agis acknowledges the existence of these functions across the regulatory and enforcement continuum and as such, each entity should address and take the steps necessary for management of the information, conducting inquiries or assessments, and the use of specific regulatory tools in consideration of all types of investigations.applicabilitythe agis is intended to articulate australian government policy and is the foundational standard, framing accountability and security for entities conducting investigations relating to the government programs and legislation they administer.the agis acknowledges the unique investigation environments for australian government entities and wholly owned australian government companies.non-corporate entities will be required to comply with agis to the extent it articulates australian government policy in accordance with the public governance, performance and accountability act 2013.entities subject to the public service act 1999 are also required to comply on the basis their decisions are in accordance with australian government policy.this agis will additionally have application for non-government entities requiring investigation standards for the purpose of providing australian

offer convenient platforms to provide access to products and services through government-enabled marketplaces. this standard for e-markets seeks to provide advice to commonwealth entities developing business cases, new policy proposals and cabinet submissions to ensure they align with whole-of-government (wofg) digital and ict policies and priorities.identify similar e-markets for potential reuse, using cross-aps archetypes to identify best-fit solutionsto minimise risk, improve consistency, accelerate delivery and lower the total cost of e-market development, agencies should consider reusing an existing investment/s.across government, e-market systems can be broadly categorised into either: informational platforms – offer advice, assistance and best practice guidance on how to best source goods and services needed by entities or their clients. transactional platforms – offer direct access to the goods and services needed by agencies and their clients.understanding the use case requirements, and thus platform focus, allows comparability to previous investment across government and the potential avenues for reuse. aligning to an archetype can help agencies find a reusable, suitable investment efficiently.apply human-centred design practices when building e-marketsthe australian public service (aps) is tasked with supporting all australians throughout their lives. adopting a human-centred design approach ensures services meet populations’ needs by being as accessible and user friendly as possible.the digital service standard v2.0 is a set of best-practice principles to help entities design and build digital services that are simple, clear, and fast. following the digital service standard ensures digital services provide public value and meet user needs, with ongoing service improvements based on evidence and learnings.adopt a consistent, effective and efficient approach for identifying businesses and individuals participating in e-marketse-markets may facilitate the exchange of sensitive data between multiple parties who may have had no previous relationship with each other. as such, it is critical that both parties are authorised, and where possible identity-verified, to reduce the risk of inadvertent access or damage to sensitive data.businesses are encouraged to create authorisations for employees and other individuals who work on behalf of the business. businesses are responsible for maintaining the integrity of their records. using global authentication gateways such as proda (provider digital access) is recommended.businesses and individuals using e-markets should be verified by an identity system. an identify system is an online environment for identity management transactions governed by a set of system rules (also referred to as a trust framework) where individuals, organisations, services and devices can trust each other because authoritative sources establish and authenticate their identities.relevant identity exchange/attribute provider accreditation standard models that should be considered in e-markets design include the australian government digital id system (agdis).user data is at the core of e-markets. e-market solutions should: protect user privacy by ensuring that practices relating to the collection and use of user data are lawful, transparent, fair, enable user participation and choice, and provide reasonable security safeguards manage digital security risk and implement security measures for reducing or mitigating adverse effects relating to user participation in e-markets.the australian signals directorate produces the information security manual (ism). the purpose of the ism is to outline a cyber security framework that entities can apply to protect their systems, including those related to e-markets, and associated data from cyber threats. details in the ism can be accessed here: information security manual (ism).ensure e-markets are used to provide products and services in a manner that prevents unfair conductbusinesses and individuals should adopt fair practices when building and engaging in e-markets by: not engaging in conduct that is unfair or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive not making false or misleading representations about the products or services they supply not engaging in unconscionable conduct (such as collecting data from competitors on price on products or services) ensuring that there is clear demonstration of intent to buy or sell products or offer services ensuring participating businesses are compliant with fair trading laws and operating fairly and competitively. fair trading laws ensure that businesses inform and protect customers.the participating businesses should consider: fair trading laws the australian consumer law and your business the competition and consumer act australian standards codes of conduct.when selling products or services, businesses need to understand and be compliant with: australia’s trade measurement laws displaying prices product labelling secure card payments warranties and refunds.australian product safety laws apply to e-markets and at every stage of the supply chain. these laws mean that participating businesses: must comply with australian mandatory safety standards must not supply banned products must report the death or serious injury or illness of a person that occurred as a result of a consumer product supplied by the vendor should immediately recall a product if it may present a safety hazard, does not comply with a safety standard, or is banned – and notify the australian commonwealth minister responsible must comply with any recall notices issued under the australian consumer law should be aware that compliance with international or other trusted safety standards does not automatically mean compliance with australian safety standards or bans.it is businesses’ responsibility to understand australian product safety laws and make sure they sell safe, compliant products. these obligations have been summarised by the australian competition and consumer commission. see: [*selling online product safety australia*](https://www.productsafety.gov.au/product-safety-laws/compliance/selling-online). address data and information privacy and legislative requirementse-market users should respect privacy by providing clear information about how personal data is handled. businesses must use and store personal information responsibly, ensuring customer consent, proper security, and anonymisation where appropriate. these practices follow the australian privacy principles, which offer flexible, technology-neutral guidelines for handling personal data.there are key legislative regimes governing digital information assets of commonwealth entities: the archives act 1983 (cth), aimed at imposing record keeping obligations in respect of commonwealth records. digital information assets used in government business are commonwealth records to be managed in accordance with the archives act 1983 (cth). the data availability and transparency (dat) act 2022 (cth) is intended to improve public sector data accessibility, facilitate its consistent sharing with privacy safeguards, enhance integrity and transparency, instil confidence in its use, and establish institutional sharing arrangements. the privacy act 1988 (cth) is intended to promote and protect the privacy of individuals and to regulate how australian government agencies and organisations with an annual turnover of more than $3 million, and some other organisations, handle personal information.there are other key pieces of legislation that may apply depending on the operating context of an entity and information set. each entity should review relevant federal, state and local requirements to ensure full compliance.for additional information see: information asset management and privacy protection.adhere to reuse principlesnumerous instances of e-market solutions and platforms exist across government, several of which may be suitable for reuse through either shared service models, creating new instances of existing cloud implementations, or leveraging existing patterns. using existing e-marketplaces is preferred to the development of new platforms.reuse and reuse potential are also enhanced by greater uniformity in data structures, specifically where data is organised and stored in a consistent manner, and uniformity in integration protocols is developed and maintained.agencies should look for the existing reusable designs on the aga website, get in direct contact with entities with comparable use cases, or leverage the existing wofg arrangements and inter-government memorandums of understanding.the australian government architecture provides information for entities on

of computer applications to meet organisational needs whilst remaining supportable and best value for money are qualities that erode over time, regardless of the technology used. whilst mainframe computers deliver several distinct advantages for certain types of computing workload, the particular risks associated with mainframe usage warrant a set of proactive standards to be adopted, which will enable the australian government to manage these risks appropriately and ensure the best performance, resilience and currency for the particular applications needed by commonwealth entities and the best strategic advantage for the nation on digital investments.these standards also recognise that mainframe computers may play an important role in emerging technology fields such as ai and quantum computing.utilise the appropriate whole-of-government procurement contractentities must: liaise with the dta contract team to identify the appropriate whole-of-government contract arrangements in place ensure all procurement of mainframe infrastructure and services are purchased under whole-of-government procurement contract arrangements.host mainframe infrastructure in complying computing facilitiesentities must: apply the principles and requirements of the protective security policy framework throughout their organisation apply a risk-based approach to cyber security for mainframe computing facilities, to align with the information security manual (ism).identify and assess mainframe applications in useentities should: implement a coherent enterprise architecture practice which clearly identifies information systems (applications) and data which rely on mainframe technology components detail how applications reliant on mainframe computing facilities support their organisational needs regularly assess whether the application meets organisational needs, including current and foreseeable changes regularly assess whether the solution architecture of an application represents the most appropriate environment available, enabling the performance and agility to meet anticipated changes in organisational needs assess the total cost of operating (tco) for applications, from a business/operational perspective and a technical perspective, including staff costs, software licensing, hardware, hosting, advisory/specialist support, and other associated costs explore the best value for money options when considering plans for existing mainframe applications. lower cost computing resources may be sufficiently fit-for-purpose to meet organisational needs, whilst enabling greater functionality and agility to meet organisational needs ensure that all mainframe applications are incorporated into a mainframe modernisation strategy, incorporating risk assessments which combine the workforce skills risk, application modernisation risk, and risks associated with not investing in application modernisation consider the overall application portfolio risk whilst assessing the best course of action for each application consider options for modernisation of applications, including the following ‘five r’s’ (courtesy of gartner):rehostredeploy the application to other infrastructure (physical, virtual or cloud) without recompiling, modifying the application code, or modifying its features and functions.replatformmigrate the application to a new runtime platform. this may include minimal changes to code for compatibility with the new platform (e.g. to use cloud services or another database platforms), but no changes to the code structure.rearchitectrestructure and optimise existing code without changing its behaviour to remove technical debt and improve nonfunctional attributes and structure. this can include a shift to a new application architecture or platform to exploit new and better capabilities. this can also include code transformation or refactoring.rebuildrebuild or rewrite the application. this includes the possibility to create a like-for-like replacement of the application and preserve its scope and specifications.replaceeliminate the former application and replace it with an available vendor solution, taking new requirements and needs into account.manage mainframe workforce skills riskentities should: manage the mainframe workforce skills risk by assessing this risk and proactively collaborating across the aps to mitigate the risk undertake, for each application, a skills assessment which includes details of the specialist skills needed to operate the application effectively to meet operational needs, including planned and anticipated changes regularly undertake an overall application portfolio skills requirement assessment, which includes any shared technology components used by multiple applications weight skills-requirement assessments against a regularly updated stock-take of the specialist skills capacity available inhouse from organisational staff, from the wider pool of aps staff resources, and from all other sources, considering the relative costs and responsiveness of these resources seek to establish resource pooling arrangements between themselves and other relevant entities and take a proactive role in working groups informing the aps commission’s digital workforce strategy to ensure mainframe skills are appropriately included in planning activities.ensure an effective hybrid technology environmentcommonwealth entities which operate mainframe environments must: ensure that mainframe-based applications and data are effectively integrated into a hybrid technology environment replicate mainframe-hosted data to other secure commodity computing environments, enabling downstream uses of data such as reporting and access via user portals.entities should: transition front-end technologies, which provide end user interface experiences and input data into mainframe applications, to commodity computing environments document back-end real-time processing and batch processing jobs based on mainframe components, and transition these to modern cost-effective and risk-balanced solutions aligned to the mainframe modernisation strategy.transition away from outdated technologieswhen considering a balanced approach to application portfolio modernisation according to their strategic and operational needs, commonwealth entities must: develop strategy to transition away from outdated and/or unsupported code bases, transaction processing environments, and database environments to mitigate the workforce skills risk, agility risk and value for money risk prioritise digital investments which enable this transition in the overall ict strategy.this will reduce overall risk for the australian government and enable greater agility to respond to changing government policy needs.adhere to reuse principlesthe australian government architecture provides information for entities on reuse.entities should: compare their requirements with those of other comparable entities and system functions, and seek to reuse learnings from preceding migrations consider specific functional and non-functional requirements prior to

management systems enable the administration of grants throughout their entire lifecycles. functions include processing grant applications, assessment of eligibility, management of grant funding, tracking of grants and grant programs, auditing, and reporting. these functions are common to many government agencies, and many solutions are highly adaptable.grants are administered by responsible agencies following the commonwealth grants rules and principles 2024 (cgrps). cgrps contain the key legislative policy requirements and explain the better practices and principles of grants administration.publish on grantconnectgrantconnect is the centralised location for publishing australian government grant opportunities and awards. the system contains information that can be used to search for new grant opportunities, find out who has been awarded grants, and watch for future programs. it is a requirement of the cgrps that grant opportunities are published on grantconnect, and that agencies report (on grantconnect) information on grants no later than twenty-one calendar days after the grant agreement takes effect.reuse existing designs, patterns and investmentin addition to grantconnect, the commonwealth has established two centralised grants hubs to be operated as shared service arrangements, providing grants administration services to client entities. these hubs increase consistency in the administration and management of grants to support more connected and seamless government services, reduce systems risk in the application of proven designs and achieve financial efficiencies through economies of scale. the two central grant hubs are: community grants hub – administers mainly community-based grants on behalf of australian government departments, agencies and organisations. business grants hub – administers mainly business-based grants on behalf of australian government departments, agencies, and organisations.under the shared service arrangements, client agencies are responsible for grant policy and the development of grant programs, while the hubs are responsible for administering grant programs at the direction of policy owners and consistent with the requirements of the cgrps.agencies should use the appropriate grant hubs except where there is a specific reason to not do so.for enquiries relating to commonwealth grants administration arrangements and the relevant estimates memorandum, please contact grantsadmin@finance.gov.au.in addition to the grant hubs, several alternative technology solutions may be considered for future consolidation exist in the commonwealth landscape. these alternatives may help achieve consistency in existing practices and simplify future consolidation where onboarding to the grant hubs is not mandatory and represent program risks due to timeframes or technical interoperability complexities. most available solutions are highly configurable and can support numerous variances in: process workflow data collection templatesbuild for reusewhere reuse has not been determined viable, agencies should provide evidence of which systems have been investigated and demonstrate how any new investment may be extensible and operationalised for reuse.implementing a grant management system with broad applicability across agencies is critical for reducing risk, increasing efficiency and supporting consistent implementation of grant programs across government.any new system should be designed with a modular and scalable architecture, allowing for future integration into other agency structures. emphasising interoperability and standardisation in technologies and data formats ensures adaptability across different agencies. additionally, user-friendly interfaces and comprehensive documentation facilitates ease of implementation and use streamlining processes and promoting consistency across agencies.engage the department of financenon-corporate commonwealth entities who want

(hpc), as a category of computing, is becoming strategically important to australia’s future as workloads such as ai large language model training, earth observation, weather and climate modelling, and other massively parallel processing workloads with very large datasets emerge across portfolios and within commonwealth entities.when determining if hpc facilities, including specialist cloud services, can and should support a government activity, various factors must be considered and balanced, as follows:identify needs and approach in advance of selecting hpc facilitieswhen determining suitability of hpc facilities entities should: consider whether their specific needs match the specialist abilities of hpc facilities, such as the need for massively parallel computation and fast processing of very large volume datasets develop and include written statements on the following balance of interests: value for money the performance and reliability of computing platforms are continually improving. commonwealth entities should explore the best value for money approach when considering the need for hpc resources. lower cost computing resources may be sufficiently fit-for-purpose to meet organisational needs. australia’s sovereign capability certain uses of hpc are critical to australia’s national interests and sovereign capability, such as: defence capabilities research capabilities biological and health-related capabilities climate and weather modelling certain types of industrial designsome aspects of cybersecurity also require hpc facilities. an emerging aspect of hpc sovereign capability is the development and training of ai large language models (llm) and other ai models with australian content, values and cultural contexts. the potential need for australia to research and build its own, foundational llm rather than relying on fine-tuning of existing, overseas-controlled models is a current discussion topic in the research community.over-reliance on foreign hpc capability and capacity is not in australia’s national interest and commonwealth entities need to consider the whole-of-government perspective and the opportunities to partner with australia’s research community to meet their hpc needs.improved, secure access and sharing of hpc resources for both researchers and government is becoming an imperative. this will include access to quantum computing facilities as these become available.there is a general distinction between hpc resources required for the research &amp; development of models, including ai llm training, and the deployment of those models for inference uses in operational settings, which does not necessarily require hpc facilities or sovereign capacity. australia’s research competitiveness research is becoming increasingly reliant on computational capacity, and there is a growing correlation between researchers’ access to hpc resources and the global competitiveness of that research. for australia’s research competitiveness going forward, commonwealth entities should consider the positive effects of supporting australian hpc research facilities through utilisation of those facilities where appropriate. australia’s trade interests to support australian industry and ensure australia’s continuing participation in global supply chain and value chain activities associated with hpc, commonwealth entities should support australian owned and operated hpc facilities wherever possible. access hpc resources utilising shared facilities available to commonwealth entitiesseveral hpc facilities and resources have been developed across government, including within non-corporate and corporate commonwealth entities.entities should: consider accessing existing hpc resources available to the aps via: hpc facilities directly owned by non-corporate commonwealth entities, including: the bureau of meteorology’s weather forecasting-oriented supercomputing facilities defence hosted hpc resources - for entities in the defence portfolio, please contact architecture@dta.gov.au for details commonwealth-funded hpc facilities in the research environment, including: the csiro’s commonwealth owned and operated facilities and national collaborative research infrastructure strategy (ncris) funded research facilities the australian national university’s (anu’s) national computing infrastructure (nci), including ‘gadi’ and other supercomputing facilities several ‘tier 2’ supercomputing research facilities, owned and operated by universities that are not commonwealth entities, but available through various access schemes. whole-of-government procurement arrangements with industry, including: dta-administered ict procurement marketplaces and whole-of-government contract arrangements, including both cloud-oriented and on-premises hpc products and services.in considering existing hpc resources available to the commonwealth, entities should: map their unique requirements against the attributes of these facilities investigate potential for utilisation of these facilities prior to considering other procurement where existing facilities are not suitable, clearly document why this is the case, as part of any proposals to utilise non-government-owned, or develop bespoke, hpc facilities if utilising cloud providers for hpc functionality, procure via buyict and the whole-of-government contracts.align to guidelines and standardsentities must: comply with the hosting certification framework to ensure cloud-oriented hpc services are hosted in certified tenancies/data centres apply the principles and requirements of the protective security policy framework throughout their organisation, including in the context of high performance computing.entities should: apply a risk-based approach to cyber security, where it comes to hpc facilities, to align with the information security manual (ism).adhere to reuse principlesthe australian government architecture provides information for entities on reuse.when utilising existing hpc facilities, entities should: document their use case, including specifics such as data types and volumes define success measures prior to utilisation record as a pattern the process of utilisation assess and document outcomes against these success measures make documentation available to other entities to enable future reuse.when investing in new hpc facilities, entities should: ensure these are built to provide maximum value to the australian government, including potential provision of shared

is one of the most valuable assets the australian government holds and should be managed in a similar way to other high value assets.entities should adopt a strategic approach to managing information related to their data and digital investments. if the information assets are proactively managed across the whole investment lifecycle, this will help organisations to more effectively achieve their organisational objectives.information asset management solutions should ensure information assets remain genuine, accurate, complete, findable, useable and secure from unauthorised access, alteration and deletion while adhering to relevant legislation. principles for well-managed information assets can be found in the national archives of australia’s (naa’s) information management standard for the australian government.entities should also adhere to ethical principles, with transparency, accountability and consent at the forefront of data collection. individuals or the community should be informed about what data is being collected and for what purpose, and how it will be used. additionally, entities may be required to gain explicit consent from individuals before collecting sensitive data.applicability of this standardthese statements detail how entities can meet this standard and comply with the information asset management policy.share and collaboratealign to data ontologieswhere possible, entities should align to the wofg data.gov.au dataset ontology. this ontology is designed to describe the characteristics of datasets published on data.gov.au. entities may also consider other portfolio or sector-specific data ontologies. this promotes data accuracy, reduces redundancy and streamlines decision making processes.classification creates a standardised approach or ‘common language’ for naming, organising, retrieving and sharing content. this helps linking content to a business context and informs decisions regarding disposal, retention, access and security. this uniformity enhances accuracy and ease of retrieval and ensures consistency, supporting freedom of information and change management processes across agencies.tools like business classification schemes, records classification tools, classification by function, functions thesaurus, and records authorities help develop an agency’s classificationalign to metadata standardsto meet requirements of the office of the national data commissioner (ondc) to enable data sharing and the naa’s requirements for effective management of information assets over time, entities should refer to the: australian government recordkeeping metadata standard – designed to help entities meet business, accountability and archival requirements in a systematic and consistent way by maintaining reliable, meaningful and accessible records ondc metadata attributes guide – developed to aid entities that are considering data inventory uplift work.alignment with common wofg metadata standards is a crucial part of effective information asset management. alignment facilitates interoperability and enhances information asset integration and sharing across entities. comprehensive metadata must accompany public datasets, retaining information on data sources, methodologies and any limitations to facilitate accurate interpretation and application.create inventories and cataloguesthe naa recommends entities design and maintain an information asset register to enable entity-wide understanding of records, information and data.the australian government data catalogue is hosted on dataplace and it is a searchable online index developed by the ondc to help users discover, request and access data held by australian government agencies. the catalogue draws on open and restricted data to facilitate the use of public sector data for innovation, research and improved government services. the catalogue contains metadata but does not host the actual data, rather it directs users to the relevant data custodians for access.implement appropriate information asset governance and risk frameworksinformation asset governance is a system for managing information assets across an entity. entities should develop an ongoing information asset governance system, as well as appoint a chief information governance officer. the foundational four provides entities with guidance on establishing an ongoing data governance program.share as open by defaultthe australian government’s public data policy resources require all commonwealth entities to make non-sensitive data open by default. at a minimum, entities will publish appropriately anonymised government data by default: on or linked through data.gov.au for discoverability and availability in a machine-readable, spatially enabled format with high quality, easy to use and freely available api access (api content on the australian government architecture provides information on how data should be shared securely) with descriptive metadata which adhere to the metadata standards using agreed open standards kept up to date in an automated way under a creative commons by attribution licence unless a clear case is made to the department of the prime minister and cabinet for another open licence.share with states and territoriesin addition to the open by default requirements, the intergovernmental agreement on data sharing between commonwealth and state and territory governments (iga) requires that public sector data be shared as a default position between states, territories and the commonwealth where it can be done securely, safely, lawfully and ethically. data shared under the iga must be in accordance with established privacy and security standards and policies, including complaints handling processes.share on dataplacedataplace is a wofg platform maintained by the ondc on which to request australian government data, including under the data scheme. the platform brings together those wanting to get access to australian government data (such as researchers and those working on public policy and delivering public services) with commonwealth entities who are the data custodians.collaborate with the private and research sectorsentities should explore opportunities to facilitate public-private partnerships and public research partnerships to jointly address challenges and opportunities, leveraging the expertise of both external sectors to derive innovative solutions that benefit the public. the private sector and researchers could be encouraged to develop applications, tools or insights that use public data, which fosters innovation.entities should also explore opportunities to provide training programs and capacity building initiatives to enhance the skills of private and research sector professionals working with public data, fostering a more robust ecosystem.collaborate with aboriginal and torres strait islander peopleentities should partner with aboriginal and torres strait islander people at all stages of the data lifecycle to ensure their priorities are reflected in data about their communities. aboriginal and torres strait islander leadership is crucial for improving the relevance, accessibility, interpretability and timeliness of indigenous data in the aps.the framework for the governance of indigenous data aims to improve the accessibility, relevance, interpretability and timeliness of government held data for aboriginal torres strait islander people. non-corporate commonwealth entities are required to prepare implementation plans responding to the actions contained within the framework together with a timeframe for implementation.appropriately create, manage, retain and dispose information assetseach entity will have business systems that create, keep and manage information assets, including data and datasets. data and datasets retained in business systems, like other information created and received in connection with australian government business, are commonwealth records and must be managed in accordance with the archives act 1983.the naa’s current wofg policy building trust in the public record: managing information and data for government and community outlines implementation actions to achieve the policy outcomes of strategic information asset governance, fit for purpose information management processes, practices and systems, and the reduction of information management inefficiency and risk.retain and disposeentities must manage information assets in accordance with their minimum retention period. these periods are usually set by the naa though legal instruments known as records authorities. disposal may involve arranging secure destruction of the information assets (including data and datasets) or, where applicable, transferring custody or ownership of the information assets to another entity through machinery of government changes. more information can be found here retaining, managing and disposing of data and datasets.transparent, responsible and secure handling of information assets is essential. the naa provides further guidance to entities on outsourcing digital storage options, including data centre, digital repository and cloud computing. a key policy to protecting australian government systems and the data they hold is the hosting certification framework. it operationalises the principles outlined in the whole-of-government hosting strategy, in particular the requirement that all data must be hosted with the appropriate level of privacy, sovereignty and security controls.datasets of enduring value should be labelled ‘retain as national archives’ (rna) in relevant records authorities. these are typically of permanent value, meaning they have historical, cultural or evidential importance and must be preserved. these should be transferred into the care of the naa. in some instances, particularly for large datasets with continuing business use, the naa may enter an agreed distributed custody arrangement, where an entity will continue to manage the dataset that has been identified as part of the archival resources of the australian government.specify and maintain stringent information asset control conditionsmost commonwealth entities are subject to mandatory requirements detailed in the australian government protective security policy framework.there are three core protective security policies that together safeguard government information assets from unauthorised access or harm: personnel security – ensuring that access to information is provided on a strict need to know basis only to people who have been assessed as suitable. physical security – preventing unauthorised access or harm to government resources, including information assets, through physical control measures such as entry barriers and security systems. information and communication technology security – having in place operational procedures and technical control measures to manage access, transmission, storage and disposal of information.plan for digital preservationensure that consideration is given to retention periods that may be longer than the life of the system that data are captured in. preserving information assets may require migration to new platforms and formats. regular and planned migration helps avoid obsolescence and ensures information continues to be accessible and usable. the naa provides further information about digital preservation planning.align operational and technological needswhen adopting an information asset management solution, entities should ensure alignment with operational needs. it is important that the solution has sufficient functionality to manage information assets appropriately.the naa’s business system assessment framework provides commonwealth entities with a consistent, streamlined, risk-based approach to the assessment of information management functionality in business systems and compliance with metadata standards. it is consistent with part 1 of international standard iso16175, which provides internationally agreed functional requirements and associated guidance for applications that manage digital records.information asset management requirements should be considered for office productivity software such as microsoft 365 as well as for current, emerging and critical technologies.ensure that data is easy to exchange and share for business efficiency and accountabilitydata interoperability enables the exchanging of data between different systems and organisations. the data interoperability maturity model (dimm) provides a way to assess an entity’s progress towards data interoperability.the decision between certain technological solutions (e.g. a sql database, data lake, data warehouse, etc.) may be significant, especially when handling larger pools of complex data. when choosing how to house their data, entities should consider: the format of the data (structured, unstructured or semi-structured) the value and purpose of the data data processing requirements data storage and budget constraints who is using the data technology and data ecosystems.more information on data interoperability can be found in the integration domain.engage earlyentities must ensure early engagement with the dta where proposals for information asset management systems either: identify that system development will be part of future budget rounds indicate the intention to undertake an investigation which may require an asset management system in the future.these should be sourced from a collaboration between information, records and data teams and ict areas. the naa, through its agency service centre, may also be of assistance.adhere to reuse principlesentities must adhere to the reuse principles.before an entity procures a system or reviews existing systems, it should consider its use-case-specific information asset requirements, including volume and nature of data, information and records, broader system purpose, performance matters, and privacy/sensitivity concerns.depending on needs, entities should consider platforms that implement mechanisms for both real-time and batch data integration, allowing the platform to accommodate different data collection frequencies based on the nature of the information. the entity should enforce stringent data quality checks during the collection process to identify and rectify inaccuracies or inconsistencies at the source. finally, standardised data formats and protocols should be used to facilitate seamless integration and ensure uniformity in the collected data.the australian government architecture provides information for entities on reuse.comply with legislationentities must comply with the following regulations: the archives act 1983 (cth), enables the naa to determine record-keeping standards and provide related advice to commonwealth entities, and imposes record keeping obligations in respect of commonwealth records. digital information assets used in government business are commonwealth records to be managed in accordance with the archives act 1983 (cth). the data availability and transparency (dat) act 2022 (cth) is intended to improve public sector data accessibility, facilitate its consistent sharing with privacy safeguards, enhance integrity and transparency, instil confidence in its use, and establish institutional sharing arrangements. the freedom of information act 1982 (cth) gives the australian public the right to access documents held by australian government agencies and ministers, unless an exemption applies, as well as rights pertaining to documents under the foi act that contain information about an individual or their business. the privacy act 1988 (cth) is intended to promote and protect the privacy of individuals and to regulate how australian government agencies and organisations with an annual turnover of more than $3 million, and some other organisations, handle personal information.there are other key pieces of legislation that may also apply depending on the operating context of an entity and information set. each entity should review relevant federal, state, and local requirements to ensure full

closure reports provide visibility of how digital and ict-enabled projects are performing in realising the scope and benefits as agreed and funded by government.project closure reports also provide the opportunity to: acknowledge project achievements and outcomes better prepare agencies to deliver future digital projects by capturing the successes and failures of a completed project record key lessons which could improve the performance of other in-flight and future projects.this standard aims to: guide closure reporting practices ensure closure reports for australian government digital and ict-enabled projects consistently include a minimum set of information.how to use this standardagencies should self-assess their draft project closure reports against each of the below criteria.agencies should aim to be strongly aligned with all 7 criteria prior to finalising their project closure reports. the table below provides guidance on how to achieve this.agencies may use their own closure report templates or use the project closure reporting templates that have been developed by the dta to align to the standard.criteria the project has recorded project performance against the agreed scope outlined in the business case (or equivalent). the project has recorded project performance against the agreed schedule outlined in the business case (or equivalent). the project has recorded achievement of outcomes and measured benefits realisation against their benefits management plan. the project has recorded project performance against the agreed budget outlined in the business case (or equivalent). the project has recorded the completion of assurance activities as per the agreed assurance plan with the dta. the project has detailed fit-for-purpose transition arrangements in preparation for a shift to a business-as-usual environment. the project has documented key lessons learned and how the lessons will be applied to in-flight and future projects for the agency and the australian government.criterion 1 the project has recorded project performance against the agreed project scope outlined in the business case (or equivalent).   strong the project closure report meets the emerging requirements. and includes rationale for and subsequent impact of any adjustments to the agreed scope throughout the course of the project. emerging the project closure report provides an overview of the project, its key objectives and scope components as agreed in the business case (or equivalent). a record of project performance against this scope is provided. and includes a record of any adjustments to the agreed scope throughout the course of the project. and a copy of the original business case (as agreed by government) and/or the project scope document is attached. nil the project closure report does not outline, or include artefacts that outline, an overview of the project and its scope as agreed in the business case (or equivalent). a record of project performance against this scope is not provided. criterion 2 the project has recorded project performance against the agreed project schedule outlined in the business case (or equivalent).   strong the project closure report meets the emerging requirements. and includes rationale for and the subsequent impact of any changes to the agreed schedule (including schedule slippages, movement of key milestones, or schedule change requests) throughout the course of the project. emerging the project closure report provides a record of project performance against the agreed schedule including the delivery of key milestones. nil the project closure report does not record project performance against the agreed schedule including the delivery of key milestones. criterion 3 the project has recorded achievement of outcomes and measured benefits realisation against their benefits management plan.   strong the project closure report meets emerging requirements. and includes an agreed plan for the full transition of ongoing benefit management and monitoring activities (e.g. governance arrangements) to benefit owners post project closure. emerging the project closure report details the project’s achievement of outcomes and their relationship to benefits realisation as outlined in the benefits management plan. this includes the progress and percentage of benefits realised, expected date of realisation and transition of benefit owners. and includes a summary of and rationale for any formal changes to benefits and their realisation throughout the course of the project. nil the project closure report does not detail achievement of outcomes and their relationship to benefits realisation as outlined in the benefits management plan. criterion 4 the project has recorded project performance against the agreed budget outlined in the business case (or equivalent).   strong the project closure report meets the emerging requirements. and includes rationale for and subsequent impacts (including impacts to wider agency) of any changes to the original budget (such as movement of funds requests or additional funding received). emerging the project closure report provides a final budget position against the agreed budget and a breakdown of the project’s performance against this budget is included. and includes a record of any changes to the agreed budget throughout the course of the project. nil the project closure report does not provide the project’s final budget position or record of project performance against the agreed budget. criterion 5 the project has recorded the completion of assurance activities as per the agreed assurance plan with the dta.   strong the project closure report meets emerging requirements. and includes an assessment of the effectiveness and value of assurance activities in achieving successful delivery of program outcomes. emerging the project closure report records the completion of assurance activities (this includes both internal and external assurance activities) as per the agreed assurance plan with the dta. and includes rationale for any material changes to planned assurance activities and a record of key outcomes from the assurance activities. nil the project closure report does not record the completion of assurance activities as per the agreed assurance plan with the dta. criterion 6 the project has detailed fit-for-purpose arrangements to transition to business as usual (bau).   strong the project closure report meets the emerging requirements. and the project closure report details the project’s sustainment funding plans and the impact of transferring incomplete or outstanding deliverables to bau (if any). emerging the project closure report details transition arrangements for the project and outlines the arrangements, delivery and responsible owners of any deliverables or scope components that remain incomplete or outstanding. and the project closure report includes a register of key ongoing risks and issues that will be transferred to bau. nil the project closure report does not detail transition arrangements for the project (including ongoing risks and issues) and does not acknowledge outstanding scope components. criterion 7 the project has documented lessons learned and how the lessons will be applied to in-flight and future projects for the agency and the australian government.   strong the project closure report meets the emerging requirements. and the project closure report articulates how the key lessons identified are linked to the key delivery challenges and/or issues experienced throughout the course of the project; this includes addressing the source of each issue. emerging the project closure report has documented key lessons from the project (including key learnings from the assurance activities) and the process through which they were identified (e.g. consultation with key internal and external stakeholders). an explanation as to how the identified lessons will be applied to other in-flight and future projects has been included and artefacts that clearly outline full lessons learned, such as

systems facilitate efficiency, consistency and a seamless workflow across entities responsible for secure access. unique business needs and governance requirements will dictate solution selection, design and implementation.the considerations outlined in this standard are intended to ensure suitable and effective permission implementations across government, assisting entities with reuse of existing investment and developing repeatable patterns.confirm permissions applicabilityentities should use the following recommended criteria to confirm the applicability and classification of a permissions solution: does the permission allow the assessed entity to be something, do something or have something? is an eligibility assessment conducted, and does a specific set of eligibility conditions have to be met? has the outcome of the eligibility assessment been captured, and the assessed entity advised of the outcome?examples of outcomes that meet the above criteria include: sharing data or consenting to usage authorising someone to act on behalf of another person or entity (e.g. power of attorney, nominee) providing a permit to a resident to do something (e.g. at their property or business).other applicable examples will depend on the business function of each entity. note that some permissions may lead to an entitlement being provided. the scope and granting of entitlements are covered in the entitlements capability in the australian government architecture.comply with legislationentities must: comply with relevant whole-of-government laws, regulations and domain standards including: archives act 1983 (cth) data availability and transparency (dat) act 2002 (cth) freedom of information act 1982 (cth) privacy act 1988 (cth) comply with any other legislation applicable to specific functions and circumstances.identify permissions-related rolesentities should: define a model for permissions that suits their needs align (and maintain) a mapping of roles in their context to this model use this model to shape decisions on solution design and ongoing use.the w3c verifiable credentials data model v1.1 (w3.org) introduces several key roles, and can be useful when considering an entity’s permissions structure. each role is defined by its specific steps and functions in the end-to-end permissions process. the following roles are introduced in the specification: holder – a role an entity might perform by possessing one or more verifiable credentials and generating verifiable presentations from them. examples include students, employees and customers. issuer – an entity that makes claims about one or more subjects, creates a verifiable credential from these claims and transmits the verifiable credential to a holder. examples include corporations, non-profit organisations, trade associations, governments and individuals. subject – an entity about which claims are made. examples include human beings, animals and things. in many cases the holder of a verifiable credential is the subject, but not in all. for example, a parent (the holder) might hold the verifiable credentials of a child (the subject), or a pet owner (the holder) might hold the verifiable credentials of their pet (the subject). verifier – the entity receiving one or more verifiable credentials, optionally inside a verifiable presentation, for processing. examples include employers, security personnel and websites. verifiable data registry – a system that mediates the creation and verification of identifiers, keys and other relevant data, such as verifiable credential schemas, revocation registries, issuer public keys and so on, which might be required to use verifiable credentials. some configurations might require correlating identifiers for subjects. examples include trusted databases, decentralised databases, government id databases and distributed ledgers. often there is more than one type of verifiable data registry utilised in a permissions ecosystem.identify permissions decision typepermissions solutions can be used within entities to assist decision-making. typically, entity decision-making may be broadly classified into: immediate decisions based on the provision of evidence or specific guardrails being met. these permissions generally allow the applicant to proceed with their application as a right, whether it is framed as an ad hoc permission or part of their ongoing eligibility. future decisions based on assumptions about future need. these decisions are predictive, and subject to future review and confirmation. for example, ‘life events’, where an entity predicts that an individual may need a service or services in the future.entities should: recognise and identify against decision types during the design stage of permissions solution development identify business and technology systems to suit decision types within the entity’s operational requirements.align operational and technological needswhile a range of functional requirements can be captured and considered, end user permission systems typically align to a supplier-specific solution. options will vary, however there are a range of vendor-agnostic system functions that should be considered and incorporated if appropriate, e.g. zero-trust architecture.entities must: ensure permissions solutions appropriately log and attribute all permissions decisions, including the denying, granting and revoking of permissions in line with auditability requirements meet privacy requirements of individuals, organisations, processes and intellectual property meet security needs, particularly if the system contains sensitive or personally identifying data or is otherwise likely a target for threat actors.entities should: design permission solutions to integrate seamlessly with an entity’s existing infrastructure ensure permissions systems enable seamless management as well as robust permission handling consider business requirements of the entity for the granting of permission, which may include client servicing, compliance or regulatory oversight consider technology functionality needed to ensure rules-based assessment, end-to-end workflow management or outcome-based information capture and notification consider services wrapper needed to maintain the proposed solution, especially in areas such as records management and storage, change management and business continuity.apply a risk-based approachentities should ensure that: permission systems do not inadvertently impact the performance, availability, accessibility or other aspects of systems to the detriment of the user experience permission mechanisms do not inadvertently make digital records inaccessible in the long term permissions are suitably applied to production and non-production environments, to ensure appropriate quality assurance of permission handling and protect information contained in those systems.there are also specific non-functional needs that require upfront consideration, for legislative or practical reasons. any system proposal that does not meet these needs would immediately be deemed unfit for implementation and ruled out of consideration. these needs may include: auditability requirements of process compliance and determination outcomes privacy requirements of individuals, organisations, processes and intellectual property security needs, particularly if the system contains sensitive or personally identifying data or is otherwise likely a target for threat actors.lower development and maintenance complexity of permissions solutionsentities are encouraged to work with potential suppliers during design and implementation phases to: minimise the development effort and pathway required, including proof of concept and solution pilots, and de-risk final solution implementation align with and adopt vendor and industry best practice when developing, deploying and applying permissions solutions, particularly incorporating lessons learned from other government entity implementations adopt streamlined maintenance models where the value may reduce overall cost and decrease ongoing management effort without adding additional risk.ensure the ongoing viability of permissions solutionsthe variety of permissions requirements across government makes it difficult to find a single, centralised solution or a universally applicable pattern. unique permissions needs will dictate solution selection, design and implementation.entities should: ensure that their selected solution is supportable, affordable, secure and fit-for-purpose check contractual arrangements, memorandum of understanding (mou) currency and aga design state in advance of procuring capability maintain their solution to ensure ongoing value and reduce the creation of technical debt.adhere to reuse principlesreuse content on the australian government architecture provides information for entities on reuse.entities should: consider permissions-specific functional and non-functional requirements prior to solution design or consideration of technology choice, including: nature of permissions user needs broader system purpose performance and availability requirements privacy and sensitivity concerns meet the requirements of the whole-of-government reuse

within the australian public service (aps) is enabled through the procure to pay (p2p) value stream. p2p refers to the end-to-end process of acquiring vendor services and products such as rfi (requests for information), rfps (requests for proposals), rfts (requests for tender), rfos (requests for offer) or rfqs (requests for quote) from providing information or proposals through to payment, facilitated by an integrated erp system.the p2p value stream encompasses the comprehensive process of managing purchasing and contract lifecycles for acquiring goods and services. p2p covers sourcing, requisition, order processing, payments, and reporting within the framework of australian government regulations, policies, and procedures. it involves the coordinated activities of multiple stakeholders including commonwealth entities, vendors, and financial management entities, facilitated by an integrated erp solution.this standard is limited to the procurement sub-capability, and should be viewed within the context of the overarching enterprise resource planning (erp) standard, and alongside those aligned to the other defined erp value streams: erp finance standard erp human capital management (hcm) standard erp travel and expense management system (tems) standardprocure to pay (p2p) can be implemented through several commercial platform solutions. these platforms may be discovered in multiple ways such as: buyict; whole of australian-government contracts; and entity implemented solutions underpinned by platforms.the p2p value stream supports the effective delivery of government programs and services, while safeguarding public funds and promoting good governance. the p2p value stream serves several critical purposes in commonwealth entities: procurement and contract management: facilitates transparent, efficient, and accountable procurement practices while ensuring value for money, ensuring adherence to government financial regulations, policies, and frameworks, like the commonwealth resource management framework (crmf) and the public governance, performance and accountability act 2013 (pgpa act). vendor management: efficient management of vendor relationships, including vendor selection, contract management, and performance evaluation, to optimise supplier partnerships and drive value for money. compliance: the p2p capability ensures compliance with government procurement regulations, policies, and standards. by embedding regulatory requirements into the procurement process, such as competitive bidding, contract management, and audit trails, commonwealth entities can mitigate legal and financial risks associated with non-compliance. transparency and accountability: by standardising and automating procurement processes, the p2p capability enhances transparency and accountability in government spending. it provides visibility into procurement activities, ensuring compliance with government regulations and policies while mitigating the risk of fraud, waste, and abuse. cost savings: the p2p capability helps commonwealth entities identify cost-saving opportunities through centralised procurement, contract management, and vendor performance evaluation. by leveraging volume discounts, negotiating favourable terms, and optimising supplier relationships, commonwealth entities can achieve significant cost savings and maximise the value of taxpayers’ money. efficiency: the p2p capability streamlines the entire procurement process, from requisitioning to payment, reducing manual effort, paperwork, and processing time. this efficiency enables commonwealth entities to acquire goods and services in a timely manner, supporting the smooth operation of government programs and services. integration: seamless integration with government financial management systems, enabling real-time visibility into procurement data, expenditure tracking, and financial reporting. data-driven decision-making: by capturing and analysing procurement data, the p2p capability enables data-driven decision-making in resource allocation, budget planning, and strategic sourcing. commonwealth entities can leverage insights from procurement analytics to identify trends, forecast demand, and optimise procurement strategies for greater efficiency and effectiveness.standard statementsentities should: ensure their erp procurement solution delivers capabilities as specified and defined below document their implementation in a way that maps modules to the capabilities and processes specified in this standard, enabling traceability and future reuse.procure to pay (p2p) value streamthe p2p value stream is realised through the following capabilities:purchasingmanagement of purchasing, an entity’s attempt to procure goods or services in line with commonwealth guidelines, primarily low complexity procurement as opposed to high value or complex procurement activities.processes and definitions purchase goods and/or

standards and frameworks, as they are developed across government and in the academic sector.understand the evolving commonwealth quantum computing technology environmententities should, prior to any internal initiation of quantum research or other investment, engage with the several principal owners that have responsibility for shaping and developing quantum capability, including: the department of industry science and resources (disr) which has overall responsibility for commonwealth policy on quantum. sitting within this portfolio are the australian nuclear science and technology organisation (ansto), which has a focus on developing quantum for research purposes, and the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation (csiro) which is investigating the commercialisation of quantum research opportunities. disr in conjunction with the office of the chief scientist were also responsible for shaping and releasing the national quantum strategy which was designed to strengthen australia’s research position while promoting opportunities for commercialisation. the department of defence has a special interest in quantum sensing and the use cryptography. defence’s next generations technology fund was launched in 2018 to support the development of insights into quantum technologies, with a specific focus on defence related application.leverage quantum opportunities for governmententities investing in quantum should consider the ways in which their investment will fit into the commonwealth’s enabling of a range of opportunities including: enabling research: through australian research council grants and the utilisation of ansto and the csiro the commonwealth can bolster the effort going into basic research. this opportunity will allow the government to potentially recoup investment in new research for business and service enablement. realising economic benefits: based on a history of quantum innovation there are promising signs for a self-sufficient ecosystem of quantum businesses in australia. if the government can invest in skills development and the access to emerging quantum technology the conditions favour new business development. prioritising cybersecurity: quantum computing is both a threat and a mitigant to securing data stores and data flow. quantum cryptography has the potential to secure both data areas. future commonwealth regulation is recommended to ensure upgraded security capability, as well as advancing the ability to secure its own systems and information flows. supporting global collaboration: australia does not yet have the capabilities to scale research into innovation by itself. by capitalising on significant international engagement government entities can leverage international relationships to build links between researchers.recognise the forecast timeframe for the development of quantum related technology solutionsquantum technologies are developing rapidly, and while the full functionality of quantum computing is still emerging, others are already in everyday use.entities should: be aware that different technologies will mature and be ready for commercial applications

agency: digital transformation agencylast updated: 16/02/2024standards for digital sourcing outlines the minimum standards for digital sourcing in government. for guidance on each of the standards, see the guidance for the standards for digital sourcing.standards for digital sourcing is presently in a consulting phase and represents best practice. to contribute to development of this position, please contact architecture@dta.gov.au.standard statementsthe standards have been organised by stages of sourcing, defined as: pre-procurement drafting requirements approach the market evaluation and negotiation buying and contracting feedback and management.stage: pre-procurementimportant digital investment factors are considered before starting a procurement.what is the standard? buyers consider important digital investment factors before they start a procurement. buyers are informed that: early consideration of the digital investment factors helps them get the outcome they need they should consider these factors during the strategic planning of their investment outcome. the digital investments factors include: be user-centred, by involving users from the start of an investment, through to operation and management. prioritise usability by ensuring the solution is developed to be easy to use. seek advice from technology, industry and procurement experts who might help to challenge traditional practices and explore new possibilities. also consider how investments fit into the existing agency and technology environments. consider the whole-of-life cost of investments, not just the initial purchase price. align with whole-of-government requirements, including but not limited to: accessibility security and privacy australian government architecture digital and ict reuse for more information on the digital investment factors see appendix a.how can i implement this standard? recraft your procurement process by introducing a stage covering planning considerations prior to drafting procurement requirements. see the digital sourcing lifecycle for more information on what a plan stage should include. ensure buyers are aware the procurement process starts a lot earlier than they may think. remind buyers the decisions they make prior to starting a procurement strongly influence their investment outcome. make delegates aware that buyers should consider and incorporate the digital investment factors prior to seeking approval. provide guidance so that buyers can understand how each factor applies to them. this can be done by linking to the dta’s guidance or by using the guidance content in internal documentation.stage: drafting requirementsrequirements are designed to allow for a range of solutions to deliver business outcomes.what is the standard? use outcomes focused requirements: outcomes focused requirements are the default and preferred option, leaving sufficient room for the market to propose solutions. the limited circumstances where technical solutions could be specified are clearly outlined (such as low value, low risk commodity purchases). there is a regular review of the limited circumstance against market offerings, which re-validates the case for each limited circumstance. creating smaller work packages, where possible, is promoted, helping to ensure businesses of all sizes can offer solutions to government. at a minimum, buyers set up their contracts to follow the digital sourcing contract limits and reviews policy. make access easy for businesses of all sizes: buyers provide clear, high-quality information up front to sellers. this includes minimising government jargon and ensuring information is easy to understand for a range of sellers. buyers cannot specify that having worked with government is a condition of getting work and are discouraged from classifying work with a higher security classification than is required. how can i implement this standard? to support a mindset shift towards using outcomes focused requirements, remind buyers this practice means the market can offer useful solutions they may not be aware of. include prompts or guidance within request for quote (rfq)/request for tender (rft) templates. embed practices within internal checklists and guidance. ensure further guidance is available by linking to the dta’s guidance or by using the guidance content in internal documentation.stage: approach the marketpanels that offer a better experience for buyers and sellers are considered (if using a panel).what is the standard? buyers are encouraged to evaluate against the list of digital certified panels if a panel is their chosen sourcing mechanism.how can i implement this standard? encourage buyers to evaluate against the list of digital certified panels in internal templates and/or guidance about approaching the market.stage: evaluation and negotiationevaluations are set up to be fair to all sellers, enabling buyers to find the best opportunities to meet their needs.what is the standard? buyers are made aware that the best value for money is not necessarily the tender which offers the lowest price. buyers do not unfairly advantage or disadvantage any tenderer. all tenderers should be afforded equal opportunity. buyers ensure there is no bias or favouritism, while declaring and managing any conflicts of interest. buyers maintain clear and transparent records to inform feedback to sellers.how can i implement this standard? prompt buyers on how to set up their evaluations to be fair in internal evaluation templates, checklists and/or guidance. ensure further guidance is available by linking to the dta’s guidance or by using the guidance content in internal documentation.stage: buying and contractingprocurement processes are streamlined to minimise burden and attract sellers.what is the standard? buyers are encouraged to simplify and streamline their procurement. buyers should: use the minimum number of steps to reach their outcome, reducing processes where possible clearly communicate their procurement process intentions to the market consider the financial impacts of lengthy processes on sellers request only necessary information from sellers use consistent contract templates where applicable (like the digital sourcing contract template suite). how can i implement this standard? encourage buyers to reduce the number of steps used to go to the market. for example, buyers could use an outcomes focused brief instead of a multi-stage request for information (rfi)/rft process. this can combine the expression of interest (eoi), rfi, rfq/rft stages into one stage. encourage buyers to use a simpler tender process where possible. this includes encouraging the use of panel arrangements for purchases falling within categories well catered for by panels (e.g. hardware, software, data centres, telecommunications and cloud). guide buyers to design contracts that focus on the quality of the outcome, with a shared understanding, high-trust partnerships, risk sharing and agreed flexibility in responding to change built in. this can be accomplished by encouraging buyers to: design their approach to market and contract formation stages to focus on what the seller must achieve (the outcomes), rather than how it is achieved (the inputs and outputs). put a greater focus on interactions over processes, responding to change over following a plan and quality of outcomes over number of hours or a set price. make the procurement process user centred by ensuring that it meets the needs of casual and experienced buyers. ensure appropriate engagement with risk. this can be done by: having the delegate as close to the decision as possible not making internal processes more restrictive than they need to be (e.g. adding additional layers on top of base cpr requirements) not mandating that buyers must obtain 3 quotes for under procurements under $80,000. minimise procurement processes that require sellers to provide onerous amounts of information that may not be required.stage: feedback and managementsellers are provided useful feedback that helps them improve.what is the standard? buyers provide useful feedback to sellers following a request for debrief. feedback: must be detailed enough to help businesses improve their offering the next time they pitch to government should be provided against the broad range of areas and criteria considered in the evaluation process. how can i implement this standard? provide buyers with guidance on how they can provide feedback. for example, they can provide feedback based on: a comparison of the offer to the evaluation criteria (not in comparison to other offers received) the strengths of the offer the weaknesses of the offer the suitability and attractiveness of the experience, qualifications, referee reports or past performance an indication of cost competitiveness the adequacy of the administrative or management systems

experience design principles support the australian public service to design and deliver people-centric and inclusive policies and services.they provide guidance for embedding human-centred design approaches into the creation of new services and the improvement of existing ones – elevating the experience for government customers, staff, businesses and third-party partners. the principles apply across all channels, whether people are interacting with government and its services online, on the phone or in person.when working on a policy, program, or behind the scenes, the principles can be applied at every stage of the process – from development to design and implementation.the principles are evidence-based, developed through extensive consultation, user research and review of best practice.together, the seven principles support the aps to ‘put people and business at the centre of policy and services’. they do this by encouraging: a good understanding of people’s needs early in

is defined as making use of something more than once for a different purpose, or for a subsequent time. in government context, reuse enables simple, consistent, and accelerated government services through standardisation and utilisation of these common components. this can be enabled via partial or full utilisation of existing solutions, or by onboarding to an existing service in place of standing up a new platform.in the australian government context, the term ‘reuse’ means using an existing component within the process of realising a new digital or ict solution, as grouped into the following categories: technology and architecture platforms and services architecture frameworks, standards, and patterns common components and code business capability and process business capability models and process designs governance models business requirements and rules procurement commercial, legal, and licensing agreements whole-of-government (wofg) procurement resources procurement processes information and data user and customer research data sets skills and capabilities digital and ict skills and capabilities reuse enables simple, consistent, and accelerated government services through standardisation and utilisation of these components. this can be enabled via partial or full utilisation of existing solutions, or by onboarding to an existing shared services arrangement in place of standing up a new platform.reuse should not stand in the way of competitiveness, innovation, and adoption of modern solutions. any new adoption of new technologies or standards, or development of new components, should enable future reuse while retaining compatibility with other related governmental policy and advice.the digital and ict reuse standard applies to non-corporate commonwealth entities subject to the public governance, performance and accountability act 2013.for corporate commonwealth entities and wholly owned commonwealth companies, the standard represents better practice.reuse guidancethe digital and ict reuse policy is underpinned by several themes: engagement, governance, architecture, and operations. as a starting point, entities should: identify their use case requirements and alignment to business capabilities start engagement with key stakeholders and entities that may harbour reusable components early in planning of proposals to identify reuseable capabilities or what is required to be built for reuse establish governance arrangements, including high-level architectures mapping to broadly applicable base capabilities, to ensure objectives are achieved and standards are adhered to throughout the delivery process if building whole-of-government (wofg) capabilities, establish and maintain the wofg base capability as well as the necessary support processes, tools, and guidance to facilitate reuse or onboarding by consuming entities understand factors effecting reuse such as commonality of the use case requirements, existing technology and data environment, scale, and the availability of the reusable content.understand use case requirementsmany different solutions and platforms are available in government. there is therefore significant opportunity to derive value from previous investment.entities should: understand specific functional and non-functional use case requirements understand how their own systems requirements can be aligned to existing systems.use case requirements of specific note may include: alignment to defined business capabilities scale/volume/frequency/availability tactical/strategic nature of solution security/privacy policy mandates existing technological landscape user and client needs/attributes nature of data contained/managed.architecturally map alignment to business capabilitiesany technological solution/system can be considered through the lens of the capabilities it enables. the open group define a capability as ‘an ability to do something’. a business capability, then, represents the ability for a business to do something.entities should: map the proposal to the business capabilities it enables, aligning it to policies, standards, and designs (representing previous investment that can be leveraged) adopt an overarching enterprise architecture approach that aligns its function and structure to business capabilities, and further to technical solutions and patterns.consider scale of solution and appropriate licencing/hostingict applications and solutions commonly used across government, including in the domains of customer relationship management, case management, enterprise resource planning, grant management, and many others, may be considered in terms of scale (micro/mid/enterprise), and supply/licencing/hosting.entities should: gain a good understanding of scale, supply, licencing, and hosting related requirements and options available as aligned to vendor offerings: micro-scale cots. locally installed on organisation computers, often with simple extensions to support specific organisational needs and integrations, and generally only supporting standardised, simple solutions and processes. micro-scale saas. subscription-based and hosted on a hosting provider’s servers. mostly used by multiple organisations in the same shared technology platform, with limited capacity for custom configurations, deployment, or hosting. mid-scale saas. similar to micro-scale saas, but with a higher level of organisational configuration and customisation than micro-scale. allow extension to handle more complex models/transactions/processes, but generally only with a small number of variations and in a simple structure or deployment context. enterprise-scale saas specific to the organisation (or organisations) they are servicing and often referred to as a “private cloud offering”. a vendor provides the software and technology layer, with contractual responsibility for design, implementation, maintenance, and support. very high enrolment, and implementation(s) should support high-volume, low-cost unit rates or high-cost specialist transactions, and support multiple customisation and localisation options beyond the vendor’s base offering, as well as allowing for significant scaling and expansion. subscription-based paas a cloud offering that broadens the saas model to include the vendor delivering infrastructure for hosting software, data, and other requisite components within the service. government platform as a service (gpaas) a combination model where government acts as the platform provider and controls the design, implementation, maintenance, and support of combined services. in this model, government may make use of specific saas services from enterprise-scale providers, and/or utilise infrastructure as a service (iaas), or on-premises (own infrastructure) to deliver a solution. distinct in that government determines and owns the implementation, the frequency of maintenance and support, and other functionality or lifecycle management. this is a strictly private-to-government arrangement, in which implementation(s) must support high-cost, specialist transactions and may support high-volume, low-cost unit rates. select a solution and arrangement aligned to the needs of the system and organisation.consider whether a solution is tactical or strategicentities should: understand whether solutions can be considered as: strategic: a solution developed to solve a business need in a manner that is ongoing and will receive medium to long-term support. tactical: a fast-tracked solution designed to solve an urgent need, often delivered with less procedural rigour and in a manner that does not suit a long-term implementation. reuse tactical solutions only for other tactical purposes, and only where components of the existing solution are suitable for re-implementation with minimal rework reuse strategic solutions for strategic or tactical purposes where suitable maintain appropriate documentation highlighting the nature of reuse and plans for managing any incurred technical debt.reuse whenever possibleentities should: investigate options to plan for and make use of opportunities for reuse. in line with the reuse policy, entities should consider reuse opportunities across the five reuse categories: technology and architecture business capability and process procurement information and data digital and ict skills and capabilities develop a clear understanding of requirements and align to business capabilities align with australian government architecture (aga) and engage with entities who have implemented and/or used comparable solutions analyse functions (such as policy, service delivery, legislative or regulatory focuses), as these can be of value in identifying potential options for reuse ensure existing solutions are suitable for reuse through either shared service models, repurposing of existing cloud implementations, or through leveraging of existing patterns suitable to support the use case enable patterns to be available to be consumed through existing whole of australian government arrangements and inter-government memorandums of understanding (mou) assess the suitability of reuse by analysing the requirements of a use case against the capabilities of the asset being reused discourage reuse of existing investment if the effort required to align it to use case requirements outpaces that of implementing a different, strategically-aligned solution.design and build for reuseeven if an entity cannot reuse an existing investment, they should still ensure that any new elements created are able to be reused by other entities. the consideration of reuse as a requirement when investing in, and maintaining, digital and ict delivery will help drive lower build and run costs, increase speed and certainty of delivery, and enable interconnectivity of services for people and businesses.entities should: document and archive patterns and other key system details in an accessible and navigable internal repository standardise data formats and interoperability protocols align architecture to industry standard frameworks such as the open group architecture framework (togaf) adhere to industry standards such as web content accessibility guidelines (wcag) adhere to applicable governmental guidelines and non-functional requirements, including those presented on the aga maintain awareness of best practice for relevant technologies at all levels including technology selection and hosting, data management, software development/quality assurance/deployment, etc. consider how a system may be appropriately modularised to enable repurposing/reuse with minimal rework/risk to the initial system maintain high quality technical documentation throughout works, that can be provided for future reuse develop the necessary support processes, tools, and guidance to facilitate reuse or onboarding by other entities.minimise technical debttechnical debt is defined as accrued work that is ’owed’ to an it system, a side effect of software engineering resulting from teams ’borrowing’ against quality by making sacrifices, taking short cuts, or using workarounds to meet delivery deadlines.entities should: consider technical debt when implementing a solution intended to be reusable consider any instances of reuse as opportunities to remediate previously incurred debt understand the long-term cost of technical debt and budget for future remediations/long term costs associated with short-term solutions ensure new technical debt is taken on in a deliberate manner and tracked/planned for, according to the situational needs and in line with a long-term strategy consider debt management as an ongoing process throughout the delivery lifecycle(s) and analyse and document appropriately establish and maintain the wofg base capability as well as the necessary support processes, tools, and guidance to facilitate reuse or onboarding by consuming entities for wofg capabilities.enable reuse by othersentities should ensure anything created is available to those who might derive benefit from it (unless there are legislative/ethical barriers). this may take the form of: senior executive-level engagement across government publishing content as a design on the australian government architecture (aga), with clear advice guiding the aga’s audience on how a component may be reusable, and on the relevant attributes (scale, technology, etc.) publishing content on another suitable repository, such as an api on api.gov.au or an open-source codebase on github clearly articulating, in a manner that suits the sensitivity of any subject matter/data, the component’s fundamental details on your entity’s website, alongside contact details working with other entities to provide them support in their reuse of investment or

defined below use archetype alignment as a focal point for identification of previous investment and assessment of solution suitability lead any investment in crm with a holistic service management and delivery approach in alignment with the entity’s overarching mission.across government, crm systems can be grouped based on their broader roles in government operations and service delivery. specific use cases can be broadly categorised into the following archetypes: government-to-individual: systems for overseeing and engaging with verified individuals and their data, generally for the purpose of individual access to government services. government-to-business: systems designed to manage and interact with verified business representatives and their data generally for the purpose of access to government services. government-to-government: systems created to facilitate interactions with authenticated government officials for fulfilling reporting obligations or delivering shared services. government-to-partner: systems created to facilitate interaction with other external companies and partners, such as suppliers/vendors and industry networks.in addition to considering the crm archetype it is important to consider scale of the crm system. entities should: consider three dimensions of scale: data volume: the total amount of data be maintained in both accessible and archive states. interaction volume: how often interactions are created, updated, and accessed, including an annual average alongside understanding of peaks and troughs (significant spikes due to external factors, such as financial, fiscal or political cycles). size of the user base: the number of users of the system and their access requirements. utilise system scale to test comparability of potential solutions, and with previous investment across government.adopt a customer-centric approach to designing crm systemsentities must: meet the requirements for designing and delivering digital government services set by the digital service standard determine and monitor appropriate performance and experience metrics in line with the digital performance standard.entities should: understand

viewpoints from stakeholders and customers, and utilise existing data and resources as well as undertaking external research explicitly outline the risks associated with both acting and remaining inactive, identify the impacts, highlight possible obstacles, and acknowledge any gaps in data and knowledge in managing customer relationships ensure crm systems and solutions can cater for growth and changing preferences without impacting performance, functionality, or stability baseline metrics via initial assessments of customer experience, then continually monitor in order to make informed

cloud computing consider the applicability of emerging trends to their needs, and factor this into their cloud strategy.emerging trends include: hybrid multi-cloud environments, can offer more customised and flexible solutions using public cloud services from different cloud services providers, allowing easier movement across different cloud infrastructures. this increases adaptability and reduces the risk of vendor lock-in. however, this approach can also add complexity, and raise the chance of misconfigurations, insecure interfaces, and other security breaches. edge computing which reduces latency, optimises bandwidth, and enhances privacy and security through balancing cloud operations with a degree of localised data processing. it offers scalability and flexibility by distributing workloads more efficiently and ensures resilience and reliability in scenarios with intermittent connectivity. cost effectiveness may also be achieved by minimising data transfer and storage needs in the cloud, particularly benefiting data intensive applications, however this is at the cost of potentially increased complexity and cost of maintenance of local and cloud infrastructures. sustainability in cloud computing is gaining attention. entities should monitor for new processes, capabilities and tools, aimed at the monitoring and management of energy consumption and carbon emissions for workloads deployed on cloud.procure via the cloud marketplaceentities should: procure cloud services, include technical, advisory, professional, managed and project services,

solution delivers capabilities as grouped into the two defined value streams of: budget to report (b2r): manages entities’ financial lifecycle from budgeting to financial statement release, covering external and internal budgeting, ledger aggregation, consolidation, closure, and reporting. revenue to bank (r2b): handles revenue generation operations to banking and treasury functions, including agreement proposals, formalisation, service delivery, invoicing, receipt management, and reporting. document their implementation in a way that maps modules to the capabilities and processes specified in this standard, enabling traceability and future reuse.budget to report (b2r) value streamthe budget to report (b2r) value stream is realised through the following capabilities: cost management general ledger budgeting and planning funds management lease accounting project accounting tax management inventory accounting asset accounting management reporting statutory reportingcost managementthe process of planning and controlling the budget at cost centre level (or relevant cost management structure) within an entity.processes and definitions maintain cost management master data by creation, change and block/deletion of cost management/controlling master data. perform cost planning including allocating budget to cost centres and periods. capture actual costs through either statistical or real postings, manually or automated. maintenance of activity-based costing/full costing models for benchmarking/cost control. distribute costs including allocating and

systems, payroll and external systems: grants, payment utility, revenue receipting, border receipting). perform exchange rate processing including the posting of exchange gains/ losses. perform gl reconciliations including the reconciliation of accounts to the sub-ledgers, reports on variances, etc. manage financial reporting period including rollover of gl balances and close and open financial

variances. analyse financial results including manual and automated analysing of budgeting and actual data.funds managementsupport entities in managing their appropriation funding and reporting requirements including special accounts, departmental, administered funds, outcome, program and appropriation types. funds management (fm) integrates to all other financial components and allows for the concurrent budgeting, funding, management and tracking of funds-relevant items and structures. financial processes are aligned in fm with concepts relating to the source of funds, budgets, how funds relate to areas of responsibility and usage of the funds.processes and definitions manage funds master data includes creation, change and block/deletion of funds management master data. manage appropriation funding includes the allocation of appropriation balances to funds, transfer of budgets, supplement and return budgets, maintain earmarked funds, etc. manage availability control includes activation and management of limits.lease accountinga lease is a contract, or part of a contract, which conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a defined period of time, in exchange for consideration. entities entered into leases are required to recognise those leases on the balance sheet through a lease liability and corresponding right-of-use (rou).processes and definitions manage lease master data includes creation, change and block/deletion of lease master data. manage lease contract includes creation and change of lease contracts data. perform valuations or adjustments to lease contract includes valuations as per lease negotiations etc. perform posting for lease contract includes posting to the assets sub-ledger or the general ledger. close contract includes cessation of lease contract data including interface to asset sub-ledger to de-recognise the right of use asset.project accountingprimarily focuses on the financial transactions relating to managing a project. this includes initiating, planning, budgeting and monitoring costs and revenue of a project. it also provides project cost collector tool through the work-breakdown structure (wbs) to support the overview management of a project.processes and definitions manage project master data includes creation, change and block/ deletion of project accounting master data (including maintenance of settlement rules). plan project budget including allocation of budget to wbs elements within a project, and phasing across financial planning periods. capture project costs

close project including lock/block of individual wbs elements or projects. report on project includes various internal and external reporting.tax managementcapture, integration, management and reporting of tax obligations and posting according to federal legislation and regulation. tax management integrates into financial accounting to provide straight-through tax data management and submission.processes and definitions conduct taxation accounting includes capture, integration and management of tax obligations and posting according to federal legislation and regulation. execute

encompasses the full spectrum of content processes, covering aspects such as creation, categorisation, quality, protection, and oversight. it is often achieved through implementation of a content management system (cms).a cms helps an entity create, publish, manage, store, and modify their digital content, generally comprising: a flexible interface that allows for the presentation of content to the user through an approval functionality, typically known as publishing an administrative backend linked to a persistent database, where an administrator can create, organise, and publish content available to the user interface, as well as undertaking other administrative functions.the cms backend is generally managed through a web interface, enabling the administrative or designated user to publish, update, or delete content with minimal need for code modifications.comply with legislation and regulationentities must: comply with relevant commonwealth legislation including (but not limited to): archives act 1983 (cth) data availability and transparency (dat) act 2002 (cth) disability discrimination act 1992(cth) freedom of information act 1982 (cth) privacy act 1988 (cth) comply with any other legislation applicable to specific functions and circumstances.align to guidelines and standardsentities must: meet the requirements of the hosting certification framework (please refer to hosting for more information) meet the digital experience policy (dx policy) and its standards adhere to the australian government style manual, that sets the criteria for australian government writing and editing align to the australian government branding guidelines meet web content accessibility guidelines (wcag) 2.2 level aa meet the standards set by the australian cyber security centre for hosting web content apply the principles and requirements of the protective security policy framework throughout their organisation, including in the context of web content management.entities should: define internal, entity-wide mandatory standards, and associated templates, to ensure consistency between different outputs and channels ensure human-centred design practices are applied when writing, hosting, and managing content leverage australian government technology options and anticipate how emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence impact, will impact web content accessibility ensure compatibility with assistive technologies such as keyboard inputs, voice commands and screen readers use automated accessibility testing where appropriate, in addition to testing content with individuals produce clear, coherent, and inclusive content that serves the users’ needs.deliver web content on digital channelsentities should: create an entity-wide channel strategy that considers user needs and entity-wide strategic direction in clearly directing content to specific channels avoid the proliferation of digital channels by consolidating like-type services onto single platforms improve government content by adopting a digital-first approach such as publishing informational content through entities websites as a primary option offer content in different mediums, such as text, images and audio and segment long documents or tutorials into chunks provide human-validated multilingual support for important information where multiple channels exist, support users to move between them at boundary points incorporate user-centred design in the evaluation, deployment/development, and testing of content and platforms, particularly with users who depend on assistive technology.develop a content strategy the apsc’s digital profession provides reference materials for development of a content strategy: [content strategy guide digital profession](https://www.digitalprofession.gov.au/content-strategy) entities should: define an entity-wide, service, or topic-centric content strategy, that covers: an overarching approach that consolidates and clarifies the roles of different digital channels appropriate alignment of content to different digital channels an overarching governance model, including alignment of responsibilities between technical and business teams define universal content rules in line with common conventions across government set expectations for specific governance of individual digital channels work towards a content governance model to improve and report on outcomes and efficiencies apply this content strategy when building new services or redesigning content, or for substantial changes such as machinery-of-government updates manage content across its lifecycle (the people, workflow, skills, and tasks involved in producing content) establish roles and responsibilities for content management to promote balanced collaboration among various subject matter experts within the government.align business, operational, and technological needsthere are numerous cms available, and each has its own unique user experience and feature set. because current cms facilitates the creation and management of content with little to no coding, it is important to identify the right cms to address the business requirements.entities must implement a cms with: the ability to create, edit, revise, audit and publish content in line with archives act 1983 the ability to have roles-based access control to minimise risk to both content administration and user access, in line with identity management best practice and [permissions aga

(digital.gov.au)](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/application-security-standard). entities should: clearly determine the purpose of a service and form a set of business requirements in advance of any procurement or development activities minimise bespoke customisation of any chosen cms, instead prioritising appropriate procurement and utilisation of a suited solution where customisation is needed, develop modules in a manner that suits broad utilisation across government, and make these available to other entities prioritise solutions with integrated reporting and analytics functionality, to gain insights for tailoring content and presentation according to the digital service standard consider the functionality needed in the cms workflow to support the roles involved in content management consider content categorisation as a vital step in both mapping out the content and scaling the content management process. conduct routine website audit and standardised inventory to effectively categorise entity’s content use information architecture (ia) to help individuals and businesses navigate a website, making it clear where they are and how to find what they need, utilising resources such as [improve your ia digital profession](https://www.digitalprofession.gov.au/content-strategy/information-architecture) focus on developing a coherent taxonomy to organise

services in a manner that allows present and future interoperation with other governmental services consider suitability of api-enabled cms, storing all content and assets and offering flexibility to distribute to multiple channels via a content api.consider onboarding to govcmsentities must: consult with the department of finance about their requirements, and determine whether govcms (as administered by the department of finance) is appropriate for their needs before moving forward with procurement leverage existing whole of government sourcing arrangements.entities should: consider the govcms software as a service solution as the first option, as a highly functional, customisable, secure, and highly resilient offering. the department of finance are responsible for the cms application and related security upgrades consider the govcms platform as a service solution when business needs are distinct and require significant customisation, and when entity teams are staffed to handle maintenance and security responsibilities where govcms is identified as a suitable platform, but there is an anticipated delay to its implementation, any interim solutions should be structured to allow seamless transition to govcms where a govcms offering is not suitable, clearly document specific requirements, solution selection, and customisations, and make these available for other entities to reuse.apply ai ethics principles and policy when ai enables contentai is increasingly of relevance to web content management, including in content generation and through the likes of
