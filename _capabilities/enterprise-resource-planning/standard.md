<p>The selection of an ERP provider for a new or updated platform, and subsequent implementation, may be influenced by several requirements, including entity complexity, attributes, and the availability and suitability of existing reusable investments. Beyond these criteria, the hosting, licencing, commissioning, and maintenance (and associated contracts) of any system should be considered.</p><p>This standard covers ERP at an overarching level. Entities should also consider the following detailed standards:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><a href="https://architecture.digital.gov.au/erp-finance-standard">ERP Finance Standard</a></li><li><a href="https://architecture.digital.gov.au/erp-human-capital-management-standard">ERP Human Capital Management (HCM) Standard</a></li><li><a href="https://architecture.digital.gov.au/erp-procurement-standard">ERP Procurement Standard</a></li><li><a href="https://architecture.digital.gov.au/erp-travel-expense-management-system-standard">ERP Travel and Expense Management System (TEMS) Standard</a></li></ul><h2>Align to the APS ERP approach</h2><p>Under the <a href="https://www.finance.gov.au/government/new-aps-erp-approach">APS ERP approach</a>, all non-corporate Commonwealth entities have autonomy and choice to modernise ERP solutions using technology and vendors that best meet their needs and budgets.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>When choosing ERP solutions or vendors, entities must align with the principles of:<ul><li>affordability: ERP systems are affordable to acquire, operate and sustain and consider re-use in their development.</li><li>choice: Entities have autonomy to select contemporary technologies that best meets entity needs.</li><li>contestability: APS leverages competition in the ERP market to improve service offerings and promote innovation.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Smaller entities (defined as having around 800 or less staff) with straightforward, or less complex, ERP requirements must:</p><ul><li>seek support from the Department of Finance, to understand ERP uplift requirements and choose cost-effective solutions. Entities can seek support by emailing&nbsp;<a href="mailto:ERPapproach@finance.gov.au">ERPapproach@finance.gov.au</a>.</li></ul><p>The approach does not prevent entities from seeking or continuing to receive transactional processing services from existing hub providers.</p><h2>Notify the DTA of any ERP investment activities</h2><p>Governance and sequencing of ERP investment is overseen by the Secretaries Data and Digital Committee (SDDC) and Chief Operating Officer (COO) Committee.</p><p>To facilitate Secretaries’ oversight of the ERP investment pipeline, entities must:</p><ul><li>identify any ERP uplifts intended over the coming years through the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.digital.gov.au/investment/prioritisation">digital investment pipeline data collection</a> so that the pipeline can be presented to SDDC as part of the Integrated Digital Investment Plan (IDIP)</li><li>identify any planned ERP uplifts through agency&nbsp;<a href="https://www.digital.gov.au/investment/strategic-planning/digital-investment-plans-dips/digital-investment-plan-policy/digital-investment-plan-dip-policy">Digital Investment Plans (DIPs)</a> to help the DTA gain a complete view of whole-of-government ERP investment planning </li><li>seek contestability and investment advice from&nbsp;<a href="mailto:investment@dta.gov.au">investment@dta.gov.au</a>&nbsp;for development of ERP business cases towards as required for New Policy Proposals (NPPs).</li></ul><p>Entities should:</p><ul><li>provide detailed business requirements and specifications to the DTA via investment@dta.gov.au, including technical scope and operating environment</li><li>obtain guidance, resources, and contribute to the Australian Government Architecture (AGA) by contacting architecture@dta.gov.au</li><li>seek sourcing advice and guidance from the DTA Digital Sourcing Branch via <a href="mailto:ICTProcurement@BuyICT.gov.au">ICTProcurement@BuyICT.gov.au</a>:<ul><li>access and use of the mandatory ERP category under the Software marketplace</li><li>ERP project planning, implementation, and transition guidance.</li></ul></li></ul><h2>Align to the ERP technical standards</h2><p>Entities should:</p><ul><li>determine and track low-level requirements in alignment with the technical standards, that break value streams into distinct functional capabilities, and within these nominate key processes that should be enabled by an ERP solution:<ul><li><a href="https://architecture.digital.gov.au/erp-finance-standard">ERP Finance Standard</a></li><li><a href="https://architecture.digital.gov.au/erp-human-capital-management-standard">ERP Human Capital Management (HCM) Standard</a></li><li><a href="https://architecture.digital.gov.au/erp-procurement-standard">ERP Procurement Standard</a></li><li><a href="https://architecture.digital.gov.au/erp-travel-expense-management-system-standard">ERP Travel and Expense Management System (TEMS) Standard</a></li></ul></li><li>utilise these standards in mapping requirements to reusable designs</li><li>document their implemented solution against these requirements, so that it can be reused in the future.</li></ul><h2>Determine if an existing solution is suitable before implementing new instances</h2><p>Entities must:</p><ul><li>consider suitability of existing instances of ERP solutions and platforms that exist across government, before effort is spent on implementing a bespoke ERP solution.</li></ul><p>Entities should:</p><ul><li>reuse existing investment through shared service models or repurposing of existing cloud implementations</li><li>if frequently affected by Machinery-of-Government (MoG) changes, align technologies with other frequently impacted entities to facilitate the efficient exchange of information and simplify future MoG processes.</li></ul><h2>Identify further ERP reuse opportunities</h2><p>Where existing shared service offerings/cloud solutions are not entirely reusable, entities should:</p><ul><li>seek to gain value from leveraging existing patterns and other artefacts</li><li>focus on reusing elements of ERP solutions that benefit from standardisation, including the data formats for payroll data, general ledger, accounts payable and receivable processes, and expense management</li><li>consume patterns and other artefacts available through the AGA’s design library, existing Whole of Australian Government Arrangements, and inter-government Memorandums of Understanding (MoU).</li></ul><p>The DTA administers the&nbsp;<a href="https://architecture.digital.gov.au/australian-government-architecture-repository">Australian Government Architecture Repository</a>, a repository of technical artefacts that can be accessed by entities to help identify reuse opportunities.
