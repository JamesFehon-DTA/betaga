## Policy requirements

### Align to the government’s APS ERP approach via the principles of Affordability, Choice, and Contestability

In self-assessing individual ERP solution needs, entities are to align to the APS ERP approach and its objectives. Refer to the new The new APS ERP approach | Department of Finance.

### Notify the DTA of any ERP investment activities

Inform the DTA of intended ERP investment activities, through the digital investment pipeline data collection (the collection that supports the Digital Investment Overview (DIO) and Integrated Digital Investment Plan (IDIP)), to enable more coordinated sequencing of ERP investments and to maximise cross-government reuse opportunities.

### Determine the complexity and unique needs of the entity to determine the approach and&nbsp;technology decision for ERP services

Assess the entity's attributes, including complexity and integration needs, to ensure an ERP decision suited to their unique requirements.

### Align to the ERP technical standards

With organisational complexity and specifics in mind, conduct work to align following considerations/works to the ERP technical standards, grouping functions around the value streams such as Finance, Human Capital Management, Procurement, and Travel and Expense Management.

### Determine if an existing entity ERP solution, or an ERP solution within a shared service offering, is suitable before implementing new instances

In line with the Digital and ICT Reuse Policy | Digital Transformation Agency (dta.gov.au), entities are to assess existing shared service offerings, and potential for reuse of other solutions presently available in government, against their unique needs prior to commencing green fields implementations
The Department of Finance will support smaller entities to understand ERP uplift requirements and assist in choosing cost-effective solutions. A smaller entity is defined as having around 800 or less ASL, and with straightforward (or less complex) ERP requirements.

### Identify further ERP reuse opportunities

Maximise reuse of data, process, systems, and contracts in delivery of commonly utilised corporate services and collaborate across government to identify opportunities to achieve efficient and effective ERP uplift.
The DTA has a repository of artefacts developed by the Commonwealth that can be accessed by entities to help identify reuse opportunities. Contact architecture@dta.gov.au to request access.

### Utilise whole of government contracts and panels to acquire ERP products and services

Use of the ERP Products and Service Solutions category on the DTA's Software Marketplace is mandatory for Non-Corporate Commonwealth entities when purchasing ERP solutions. Procure services related to ERP uplift and integration through the DTA’s Digital Panels or Whole-of-Government contracts.
