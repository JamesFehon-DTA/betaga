title: 'High performance computing'
description: 'High Performance Computing (HPC) refers to the practice of employing advanced computing techniques, typically utilising parallel processing and supercomputers, to solve complex problems that require significant computational power and data storage capabilities. As with other types of computing, HPC access can be organised through an on-premises model, a shared data centre or via cloud services where leading public cloud and specialist providers are emerging.'
