<p>The Debt Management Standard ensures that debt management practices are consistent, legally compliant, and aligned with operational and technological needs while promoting responsible financial management and risk mitigation. There are several technologies available and widely used across Commonwealth entities, generally as either modules of a broader-purpose CRM platform or as specific implementations of a Case Management system, that support responsible and ethical debt recovery practices.</p><p>It is critical this standard be considered alongside those of complementary capabilities:</p><ul><li>Case Management</li><li>Customer Relationship Management (CRM)</li><li>Entitlements</li><li>Information Asset Management</li><li>Information Asset Security</li><li>Payments</li></ul><h2>Comply with legislation and regulation</h2><p>Entities must:</p><ul><li>comply with relevant Commonwealth legislation including (but not limited to):</li><li><em>Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013</em> (Cth) (PGPA Act)</li></ul><p>In accordance with the PGPA Act, the accountable authority is required to promote the financial sustainability and the proper use and management of public resources of their entity.
