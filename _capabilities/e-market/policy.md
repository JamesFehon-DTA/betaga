### Apply human-centred design practices when building e-markets

Follow the Digital Service Standard v2.0 to establish the requirements for designing and delivering digital government services. 
Put people and business at the centre of the establishment of e-markets. 
Create and maintain e-markets that are user-friendly, inclusive, adaptable and measurable.

### Adopt a consistent, effective and efficient approach for identifying businesses and individuals participating in e-markets

Align to identity management best practices and policies. 
Use providers accredited through the Services Australia Identity Exchange under the Trusted Digital Identity Framework (TDIF) when verifying the identity of individuals and businesses and ensuring government data is protected against cyber threats.

### Ensure e-markets are used to provide products and services in a manner that prevents unfair conduct

Ensure businesses and individuals adopt fair practices when building and engaging in e-markets and follow product safety standards.

### Identify similar e-markets for potential reuse, using cross-APS archetypes to identify best-fit solutions

Determine your specific requirements, and categorise as either an informational or transactional platform, to appropriately determine potential candidates for reuse.

### Adhere to reuse principles

Align to the Digital and ICT Reuse Policy and Reuse standard.
Analyse the current e-markets technology environment against your requirements, identifying gaps and opportunities for reuse. 
Ensure the ongoing viability of information asset solutions through continual improvement around processes, features, data, security, technology, skills and cost.
