<p>Case management is the process of managing a series of steps or events to reach a resolution. Case management systems help track and manage cases from start to finish. The case management systems normally would include the following functionalities:</p><ul><li>controls on how information is shared and restricted</li><li>processes for auditing and overseeing workflows</li><li>the ability to route cases dynamically based on specific needs</li><li>clear goals and outcomes that are recorded</li><li>proper collection and assignment of information</li></ul><p>Because different entities have unique case management needs, a single, centralised system or one-size-fits-all approach is not practical. Each entity must choose, design and implement a solution that fits its specific requirements.&nbsp;</p><h2>Understand alignment to case management archetypes&nbsp;</h2><p>Entities should:</p><ul><li>align their requirements with common government case management archetypes to enable reuse:<ul><li>Contract management</li><li>Investigation management</li><li>Service management</li><li>Human resources management</li><li>Complaints management</li><li>Compliance management</li><li>Claims management.</li></ul></li></ul><h2>Develop a comprehensive understanding of requirements</h2><p>Entities should:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>ensure that systems meet non-functional requirements including:<ul><li>auditability requirements of cases processes and/or outcomes</li><li>privacy requirements of individuals, organisations, processes, or intellectual property</li><li>security needs, particularly if the system contains sensitive or personally identifying data or is otherwise likely a target for threat actors</li><li>availability/redundancy, especially in the case of systems supporting round-the-clock needs such as medical or emergency services activities.&nbsp; </li></ul></li><li>consider system scale, assessing:<ul><li>case/data volume: how much data needs to be stored and accessed</li><li>frequency of case interactions: how often cases are created, updated or retrieved</li><li>user base size: the number of system users and their access needs</li></ul></li><li>ensure their case management solution planning considers delivery of the key functional aspects:<ul><li>controls on how information is shared and restricted</li><li>processes for auditing and overseeing workflows</li><li>the ability to route cases dynamically based on specific needs</li><li>clear goals and outcomes that are recorded</li><li>proper collection and assignment of information</li></ul></li></ul><h2>Check for existing re-useable case management designs before engaging in new development processes&nbsp;</h2><p>Before developing a new system, entities should:</p><ul><li>explore existing government case management platforms</li><li>investigate whole-of-government arrangements and Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs).</li></ul><h2>Build for reuse&nbsp;</h2><p>If an existing system cannot be reused, entities should:</p><ul><li>provide evidence of evaluations conducted on existing government systems</li><li>demonstrate how the new system will be scalable, reuseable and interoperable with other government platforms.</li></ul><h2>Lower development and maintenance complexity of case management solutions&nbsp;</h2><p>Entities should:</p><ul><li>minimise the need for extensive programming through modular design</li><li>facilitate rapid development and testing of new case management processes</li><li>improve business process understanding and stakeholder satisfaction</li><li>ensure solutions are supportable, affordable, secure and fit for purpose and consider the suitability of low-code/no-code solutions prior to development or adoption of a platform</li><li>review contractual arrangements, MoU currency and AGA designs before selecting a solution.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>Understand the existing technology environment&nbsp;</h2><p>Entities should:</p><ul><li>assess how their case management needs fit within the broader government digital landscape</li><li>consider cloud adoption, legacy system dependencies, and long-term ICT strategies</li><li>standardise data structures and integration protocols to enhance compatibility and reuse across government</li><li>align technological demands with previous government investments to enable reuse.</li></ul>
