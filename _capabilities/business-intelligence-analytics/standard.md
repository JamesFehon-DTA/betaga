<p>The Business Intelligence Analytics Standard helps to ensure that entities conduct business intelligence analytics activities in a secure, ethical, effective, and efficient manner. Several technologies are available and widely used across Commonwealth entities. These can assist as the Australian Government commits to collecting and analysing data to assess whether policies and services are achieving their intended purpose and are being implemented in the best possible way. By harnessing emerging analytics tools such as machine learning, entities can predict service needs, improve user experience, support evidence-based decisions, and gain efficiencies in operations.</p><p>It is critical this standard be considered alongside those of complementary capabilities:</p><ul><li>Data Analytics</li><li>Information Asset Security</li><li>Information Asset Management</li><li>Permissions</li><li>Privacy</li></ul><h2>Comply with legislation</h2><p>Entities must:</p><ul><li>comply with relevant Commonwealth legislation including (but not limited to):<ul><li><em>Archives Act 1983&nbsp;</em>(Cth)</li><li><em>Data Availability and Transparency</em> (DAT) <em>Act 2022</em> (Cth)</li><li><em>Privacy Act 1988</em> (Cth)</li></ul></li><li>comply with any other legislation applicable to specific functions and circumstances.</li></ul><p>Entities should:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>make use of the <a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/privacy-guidance-for-organisations-and-government-agencies/more-guidance/guide-to-data-analytics-and-the-australian-privacy-principles">Guide to Data Analytics and the Australian Privacy Principles</a>, by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner.

As such, policy-focused entities may need to enhance their data capabilities to answer complex questions through advanced data analytics or data integration.
