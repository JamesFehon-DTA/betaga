<p class="callout-box">The AGLS Metadata Standard is no longer mandated for agencies and the National Archives of Australia has decommissioned the AGLS website.&nbsp;</p><p>The AGLS Metadata Standard was introduced to improve the visibility and availability of online resources. It provided a set of metadata properties and associated usage guidelines for online information and services, particularly those managed by government agencies.</p><p>The standard was published as Australian Standard AS 5044-2010. The 2010 revision superseded AS 5044-2002 AGLS Metadata Element Set and was renamed the AGLS Metadata Standard. This revised version took into account changes introduced by the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) in January 2008. It also made technical changes to support linked data and Semantic Web projects, recognising that the internet was no longer just a medium for publishing human-readable documents.</p><h2>Applicability</h2><p>The AGLS Metadata Standard is no longer applicable. Any entity that has identified business value in using AGLS metadata may continue to do so at their own discretion.</p><p>The AGLS Metadata Standard was mandated for non-corporate Commonwealth entities between 2000 and 2023.</p><p>The National Archives no longer has responsibility for AS 5044-2010, but provided advice on <a href="https://www.naa.gov.au/node/3386">metadata for the web</a> and a <a href="https://www.naa.gov.au/node/3388">case study on Geoscience Australia</a> to assist agencies in the post-AGLS environment.&nbsp;</p><h2>Access the standard</h2><p>Standards Australia hosts archived copies of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.standards.org.au/search-results?query=AS5044%3A%202010">AGLS Metadata Standard</a> (full text).&nbsp;</p>
