<p>A common, easily recognisable brand ensures clear and consistent branding across Australian Government departments and agencies. These guidelines have been developed to help departments and agencies ensure the Australian Government logo is consistently applied to products such as official Australian Government documents and publications.&nbsp;</p><h2>Applicability&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>Entities are required to comply with the branding policy unless an exemption, or permission to use a co-branded logo, has been granted by the minister responsible for the branding policy, i.e. the Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister. Requests for an exemption or a co-branded logo are considered on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp;</p><p>This Government Branding policy position represents the DTA’s opinion of best practice and will be further refined upon feedback provided.&nbsp;</p>

## Policy requirements

### Requirement 1

Develop all branding with reference to, and consistent with, the Australian Government Branding Guidelines, maintained by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.
