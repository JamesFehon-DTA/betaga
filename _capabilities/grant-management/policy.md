## Policy requirements

### Publish on GrantConnect

Make grant opportunity guidelines and grant awards publicly available on GrantConnect, except where there is a specific policy reason not to, or when grants are provided on a one-off or ad hoc basis.

### Reuse existing designs, patterns, and investments

Reuse existing standards and designs prior to considering alternative new developments. This will aid in minimising risk, improving consistency, accelerating delivery, and lowering total cost of grants management.

### Build for reuse

Where reuse is not possible, provide evidence of which systems across government have been investigated. Include details on the usage, users, scale, and security classification of the system. Demonstrate how any new investments may be extensible and operationalised for reuse. Highlight potential benefits to agencies seeking similar capabilities.

### Engage the Department of Finance

Non-corporate Commonwealth Entities (NCEs) should contact the Department of Finance in the first instance when developing grant management platforms.
