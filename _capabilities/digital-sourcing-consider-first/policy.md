The <em>Digital sourcing consider first policy</em> is the first policy issued under the framework.</p><p>This policy aims to guide agencies through early consideration of important factors that help investments meet their intended outcomes.</p><h2>Applicability</h2><p>The Digital Sourcing Consider First Policy is effective from 1 July 2019. The policy applies to Non-Corporate Commonwealth Entities, as defined by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2014C00317"><em>Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013</em></a>, and may be leveraged by other Commonwealth entities and companies.</p><p>This policy must be applied to any investment in digital products and/or services with an expected or realised&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finance.gov.au/government/procurement/commonwealth-procurement-rules/value-money">whole-of-life</a>&nbsp;cost of $80,000 or greater (GST inclusive).</p><p>The procurement threshold is $80,000 (GST Inclusive) at Paragraph 9.7a of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finance.gov.au/commonwealth-procurement-rules/">Commonwealth Procurement Rules</a>. If the threshold is changed, this policy will automatically apply the new threshold.</p><p>Agencies are still encouraged to apply the policy for each investment below $80,000 (GST inclusive).</p><p>The policy must be used during the identification of business needs and before making any investment decisions (prior to sourcing, building or re-using a digital product and/or service). The policy does not replace other evaluation requirements.</p><h2>Access the policy&nbsp;</h2><p>The buyict.gov.au website hosts the <a href="https://www.buyict.gov.au/sp?id=resources_and_policies&amp;kb=KB0010637"><em>Digital sourcing consider first policy</em></a> (full text).</p><h2>Consider first assessment tool</h2><p>Agencies must complete a self-assessment using the <a href="https://www.buyict.gov.au/policy?id=consider_first">Consider first assessment tool</a> for each applicable investment.</p><p>The tool must be used during identification of business needs and before making any investment decisions (prior to sourcing, building or re-using a digital product and/or service).</p>
