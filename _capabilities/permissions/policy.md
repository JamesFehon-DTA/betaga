<p>The permissions policy is essential for evaluating and recording who can access specific government information, systems or resources, and enabling access to users according to their granted permissions.&nbsp;</p><h2>Applicability</h2><p>Digital investment proposals are assessed against this policy by the DTA through the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dta.gov.au/advice/digital-and-ict-investments/digital-and-ict-investment-oversight-framework-iof">Digital and ICT Investment Oversight Framework (IOF)</a>.</p><p>Commonwealth entities are encouraged to apply this policy to all digital investments.</p>

## Policy requirements

### Confirm permissions applicability

Not all proposed solutions may be permissions related. The Permissions standard has identified a set of criteria questions to assist entities in determining applicability of permissions guidance.

### Identify permissions related roles

Permission business processes can be depicted through relevant use cases and the identification of key roles.

### Identify permissions decision type

Permissions decisions are typically in response to either an immediate or known future need. Identifying the decision type assists in shaping design of business and technology systems underpinning operations.

### Lower development and maintenance complexity of permissions solutions

Adopt supplier guidance and industry best practice during the solution design and development phases of the solution implementation.

### Ensure the ongoing viability of permissions solutions

Entities should ensure continual improvement of processes, and features, data, security, technology, skills, and cost should remain a focus to maximise functionality, reduce risk, and minimise accumulation of technical debt.

### Align operational and technological needs

Analyse and assess specific organisational needs, and develop a comprehensive set of technology, business, service, and compliance requirements that would enable or support permissions functionalities.

### Apply a risk-based approach to permissions

Assess and manage risks associated with the handling of permissions, to inform design and investment decisions.

### Adhere to reuse principles

Give priority to the adoption of reuseable digital and ICT solutions, patterns, or knowledge, and, where necessary, design new solutions with a focus on future reuse.

### Comply with legislation and regulation

Entities must comply with any legislation relevant to their circumstances.
