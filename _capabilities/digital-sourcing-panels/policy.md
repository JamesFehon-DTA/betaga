It helps government buyers use digital panels and enables new sellers to join panels more often. This policy is guided by principles that support a flexible government and an environment that fosters digital.</p><p>The policy supports the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.buyict.gov.au/sp?id=policy">Digital Sourcing Framework</a> and delivers on the ICT Procurement Taskforce’s 2017 recommendation for the ‘immediate simplification of a range of ICT procurement practices for agencies, including reforms to ICT procurement panel arrangements’.</p><p>To do this the policy aims to:</p><ul><li>modernise panels</li><li>make panels easy to use for buyers and sellers</li><li>improve access to emerging products and services</li><li>reduce costs and duplication.</li></ul><p>The policy creates a panel certification scheme supported by eight principles.</p><p>The certification scheme helps agencies to be recognised as digital sourcing leaders who provide panels that meet the modern expectations of buyers. These panels will attract more buyers and provide them with opportunities for buying the latest technology.</p><p>Having certified panels will help agencies attract interest from sellers who are seeking a better experience when selling to government.</p><h2>Applicability</h2><p>The Digital Sourcing Panels Policy applies to non-corporate Commonwealth entities, as defined by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2014C00317"><em>Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013</em></a>. Corporate Commonwealth entities may choose to apply the policy.</p><p>The policy is designed for new and updated digital and ICT multi-supplier panels, with two or more sellers. Updated panels refer to any of the following scenarios:</p><ul><li>opening a panel to new sellers</li><li>any change to categories, terms, head agreements</li><li>exercising extension options</li><li>making substantial changes to a panel.</li></ul><p>New panels should be certified through the <a href="https://www.buyict.gov.au/policy?id=panel_cert">ICT Procurement Portal</a>, and buyers and sellers are encouraged to browse the currently <a href="https://www.buyict.gov.au/sp?id=resources_and_policies&amp;kb=KB0010682&amp;kb_parent=KB0010686">certified digital panels</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Access the policy</h2><p>The <a href="https://www.buyict.gov.au/">BuyICT</a> website hosts the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.buyict.gov.au/sp?id=resources_and_policies&amp;kb=KB0010640">Digital Sourcing Panels Policy</a> (full text).</p>
