## Policy requirements

### Appropriately create, manage, retain, and dispose information assets

Implement appropriate creation, management, retention, archiving, and destruction practices. Ensure information assets are created and managed according to their value by way of transparent, responsible, and secure handling of information assets. Stringent data ownership and control conditions should be specified and maintained; and appropriate digital preservation planning undertaken.

### Share and collaborate

Prioritise the transparent and collaborative governance of information assets. Align with common data ontologies, release non-sensitive data openly, optimise public data use. Share data with states and territories, partner with the research sector and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and implement robust data governance and risk frameworks for responsible information asset management.

### Adhere to reuse principles

Analyse the current information asset management technology environment against business requirements, identifying gaps and opportunities for reuse. Ensure the ongoing viability of information asset solutions through continual improvement of processes, and features, data, security, technology, skills, and cost.

### Comply with legislation

Establish robust practices that align with all relevant legislation, including (but not limited to) the Data Availability and Transparency (DAT) Act 2022 (Cth), the Archives Act 1983 (Cth), and the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth).
