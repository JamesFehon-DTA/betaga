## Policy requirements

### Requirement 1

The policy aims to:

give agencies access to a competitive, vibrant and diverse market of sellers
address the imbalance between sellers who already have access and new players
guide the development of outcomes-focused requirements and documentation
ensure that agencies provide better feedback to sellers
improve visibility of opportunities available across government for all sellers.

The policy does this by providing government buyers with a checklist. The checklist helps agencies ensure fairness when sourcing digital products or services.

The Fair Criteria Checklist must be completed for each applicable procurement of digital products or services. This should be done prior to scoping proposed solutions and drafting requirements. The checklist outlines each stage of sourcing and provides agencies with advice on how to meet the fairness criteria.
