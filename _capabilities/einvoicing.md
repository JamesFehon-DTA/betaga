# Policy 
This policy describes the requirements for entities planning digital investments and adopting eInvoicing processes.

## Applicability
Digital investment proposals are assessed against this policy by the DTA through the Digital and ICT Investment Oversight Framework (IOF).

Commonwealth entities are encouraged to apply this policy to all digital investments.

## Policy requirements

Meet legal, regulatory, and policy requirements

Meet the requirements of relevant legislation and policy, including the Payment Time Reporting Act 2020 (Cth) and the Supplier Pay on Time or Pay Interest Policy (RMG417). 

### Be able to systematically receive Peppol-compliant eInvoices
An entity must be able to receive Peppol-compliant eInvoices as defined by the ATO as the Australian Peppol authority.

### Promote supplier take-up of eInvoicing
All Commonwealth entities must promote the participation of suppliers to utilise eInvoicing through the mandatory payment terms of 5 days compared to 20 days non eInvoicing.

### Adopt the full functionality of eInvoicing
All Commonwealth entities must progress to full transition to eInvoicing both for rendering Peppol-compliant eInvoices for the sale of Government goods and services as well as moving to only utilise suppliers registered on the Peppol Network as administered by OpenPeppol.

### Adhere to reuse principles
Entities must give priority to the adoption of reuseable digital and ICT solutions, patterns, or knowledge, and, where necessary, design new solutions with a focus on future reuse.
