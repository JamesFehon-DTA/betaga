<p>This policy describes the requirements for entities planning digital investments requiring network security consideration.</p><h2>Applicability</h2><p>Digital investment proposals are assessed against this policy by the DTA through the <a href="https://www.dta.gov.au/advice/digital-and-ict-investments/digital-and-ict-investment-oversight-framework-iof">Digital and ICT Investment Oversight Framework (IOF)</a>.</p><p>Commonwealth entities are encouraged to apply this policy to all digital investments.</p>

## Policy requirements

### Comply with legislation

An entity must comply with any legislation relevant to its circumstances.

### Align to guidelines and standards

All Commonwealth entities must comply with the Protective Security Policy Framework, as well as any other mandatory frameworks, policies, and standards.

### Model your topology, and develop a strategic approach

A standardised understanding of network design and topology, and an overarching strategic approach, will inform network design, security solution development, and potentially assist with fault finding and remediation.

### Select and implement appropriate network security controls

There is a wealth of security industry guidance that supports best practice development of repeatable network security architectures.

### Recognise emerging network security trends

Network Security is constantly evolving. Emerging approaches should be considered for inclusion in any investment.

### Adhere to reuse principles

Entities must give priority to the adoption of reuseable digital and ICT solutions, patterns, or knowledge, and, where necessary, design new solutions with a focus on future reuse.
