<p>This policy describes the requirements for entities planning digital investments and adopting cloud financial optimisation practices and solutions.&nbsp;</p><h2>Applicability</h2><p>Digital investment proposals are assessed against this policy by the DTA through the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dta.gov.au/advice/digital-and-ict-investments/digital-and-ict-investment-oversight-framework-iof">Digital and ICT Investment Oversight Framework (IOF)</a>.</p><p>Commonwealth entities are encouraged to apply this policy to all digital investments.</p>

## Policy requirements

### Comply with legislation

Establish robust practices that align with acts relevant to the operational context of the cloud environment(s).

### Research and assess Cloud FinOps practices and solutions

Entities should thoroughly understand and document their own operational needs, conduct pragmatic research, and determine specific suitability when exploring Cloud FinOps practices and solutions to ensure they optimise their cloud investment, align financial and operational goals, and achieve cost-efficiency and scalability in their cloud operations.

### Incrementally improve strategies for Cloud FinOps

Entities should adopt incremental improvement strategies for Cloud FinOps. A pragmatic, step-by-step approach to refining and enhancing cloud financial operations will allow entities to optimise practices with evolving requirements.

### Reuse previous Cloud FinOps investment

When establishing a Cloud FinOps function, entities should reuse existing Cloud FinOps solutions wherever possible, leveraging proven practices and promoting efficiency. As an evolving area, opportunities for reuse are expected to grow. If current Cloud FinOps processes are found inadequate, entities should evaluate the applicability of other relevant processes and practices to ensure maximal effectiveness and efficiency of cloud financial operations.

### Build for reuse and the long-term

Where the reuse of existing Cloud FinOps solutions is not possible, entities should ensure new investment can itself be of benefit to other entities seeking similar capabilities. To ensure the ongoing effectiveness of Cloud FinOps solutions, entities must commit to the continuous improvement of processes, features, data, security, technology, skills, and cost management.
