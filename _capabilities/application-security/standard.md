<p>The Australian Government ensures the safety and security of its operations to remain a trusted custodian of sensitive information. It will continue to maintain the safe, secure operation of government systems and technology through the effective implementation of the <a href="https://architecture.digital.gov.au/information-security-manual-ism">Information Security Manual</a>, <a href="https://architecture.digital.gov.au/protective-security-policy-framework-pspf">Protective Security Policy Framework</a>, the <a href="https://architecture.digital.gov.au/essential-eight">Essential Eight Mitigations</a>, and by increasingly adopting secure-by-design and secure-by-default principles and tactics.</p><p>The application security standard ensures that applications are developed and maintained with security in mind, protecting sensitive data and preventing unauthorised access, use, disclosure, modification, or destruction of data.&nbsp;</p><p>Cornerstones of investment include the secure environments where applications are hosted, and appropriate proactive approaches to detective, reporting, and corrective measures.</p><p>It is critical this standard be considered alongside those of complementary capabilities:</p><ul><li><a href="https://architecture.digital.gov.au/capability/information-asset-security">Information Asset Security</a></li><li><a href="https://architecture.digital.gov.au/capability/network-security">Network Security</a></li><li><a href="https://architecture.digital.gov.au/capability/permissions">Permissions</a>.</li></ul><h2>Be Secure-by-Design</h2><p>Entities should:</p><ul><li>take a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/governance-and-user-education/secure-by-design">Secure-by-Design</a>&nbsp;approach to application development as defined and recommended by the Australian Signals Directorate</li><li>implement&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/essential-eight/essential-eight-maturity-model">Essential Eight Maturity Level 2</a>&nbsp;mitigations as a minimum</li><li>implement&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/essential-eight/essential-eight-maturity-model-ism-mapping">ISM controls</a>&nbsp;within the defined areas of:</li></ul><ol><li>application control</li><li>patch applications</li><li>configure Microsoft Office macro settings</li><li>user application hardening</li><li>restrict administrative privileges</li><li>patch operating systems</li><li>multi-factor authentication</li><li>regular backups</li></ol><h2>Align operational and technological needs</h2><p>Entities should:</p><ul><li>design applications to integrate seamlessly with existing security infrastructure to provide layered security</li><li>use trusted suppliers vetted as part of cyber supply chain risk management assessments</li><li>record suppliers on their approved supplier list once vetted</li><li>ensure security solutions for applications are scalable and flexible to adapt to evolving threats and technological advancements</li><li>integrate security awareness and training programs, as human factors may pose a significant risk to the security of applications.</li></ul><h2>Apply a risk-based approach</h2><p>Entities should:</p><ul><li>be careful to ensure that security mechanisms do not inadvertently impact the performance, availability, accessibility, or other aspects of systems to the detriment of the user experience</li><li>prioritise security considerations throughout all stages of the software development lifecycle, including architecture, design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance of applications</li><li>integrate security awareness and training programs</li><li>demonstrate and foster a culture of security awareness and management among their employees.</li></ul><h2>Implement preventative measures</h2><p>Entities should:</p><ul><li>implement access controls to ensure that users are granted the minimum level of access necessary to perform their job function, in line with a ’zero trust‘ approach</li><li>define and manage user permissions based on job roles, streamlining access management and reducing potential security risks.

incidents.</li></ul><h2>Implement corrective measures</h2><p>Entities should:</p><ul><li>establish a process for timely identification of attacks to prevent further compromise of the application’s
