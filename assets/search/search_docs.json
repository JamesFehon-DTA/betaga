The principles apply across all channels, whether people are interacting with government and its services online, on the phone or in person.When working on a policy, program, or behind the scenes, the principles can be applied at every stage of the process – from development to design and implementation.The principles are evidence-based, developed through extensive consultation, user research and review of best practice.Together, the seven principles support the APS to ‘put people and business at the centre of policy and services’. They do this by encouraging: a good understanding of people’s needs early in the program/project lifecycle consistent consideration of customer and staff experiences streamlined service delivery across government.The principles are designed to work hand in hand with the Digital Service Standard, within the Digital Experience Policy.They were developed as part of the APS Reform Agenda to deliver better outcomes for the community and contribute to a fairer, more inclusive Australia. They also build on the APS Vision for User-Centred Service Excellence: ‘Reliable and accessible services, when and how you need them’.ApplicabilityThe APS Experience Design Principles were developed by Services Australia and the Australian Public Service Commission for use across the public service.They are endorsed by the executive Partnership Priorities Committee for use by non-corporate Commonwealth entities. They apply to both new and existing services for staff and the public.The principlesSimpleOutcomes People find information and communication clear, easy to understand and actionable. Services and support are easy to access. Tasks and processes are intuitive and easy to complete.When we make things easier, we reduce the time and effort it takes for people to get things done.By making sure information and services are easy to access and follow, we reduce the chance of errors without causing unnecessary confusion or frustration. Simple services create better outcomes for everyone.Design criteria Easy to use: We ensure people can easily access and use services when they need to. Clear: We design content and communication that’s easy to find, understand and action. Efficient: We ensure people can complete tasks with minimum effort or intervention.InclusiveOutcomes People have equitable access to all parts of our services in ways that meet their needs based on their circumstances. People understand their options and feel empowered to make decisions based on their needs.People have different lived experiences, abilities and needs.

This supersedes the below guidance, which is retired effective that same date.","url":"/resource/adoption-of-artificial-intelligence-in-the-public-sector/","domain":"","type":"Resource","subtype":"","content":"DetailsOn 1 September 2024, the Policy for the responsible use of AI in government took effect. This supersedes the below guidance, which is retired effective that same date.Adoption of AI in the Public SectorBy 2030, it is estimated that Artificial Intelligence (AI) and associated machine-assisted decision-making technologies will contribute more than $20 trillion dollars to the global economy. AI can present many benefits to government and users of their services. For example, AI can be used to manage resources, improve efficiencies, and enhance public services. The use of AI, however, comes with unique risks and challenges for government agencies. Mitigating these risks and challenges is possible and will allow agencies to recognise these benefits.The term ‘AI’ is often used interchangeably to describe several technologies within AI that are used in machine-assisted decision-making applications including machine learning, robotic process automation (RPA), natural language programming, deep learning (neural networks), computer vision and robotics.AI systems embrace a family of technologies that can bring together computing power, scalability, networking, connected devices and interfaces, and data.These systems can be programmed to perform specific tasks such as reasoning, planning, natural language processing, computer vision, audio processing, interaction, prediction and more. With machine learning, AI systems can improve on tasks over time according to a set of human-defined objectives and can operate with varying levels of autonomy.Despite the potential for achieving better efficiencies through incorporating machine assistance into decision-making, application to government decisions, such as regulatory or service delivery, should strongly consider the potential impacts of adverse outcomes that can impact individuals and business.Current usage in the APSAI is currently available in several commercial products used across Commonwealth Agencies. Agencies looking to adopt established technologies which use AI still have an obligation to manage the benefits and risks associated with the use of that technology. Agencies should also pay particular attention to the governance and ethical implications of adoption and application of the AI system. Usage must also be authorised by law, particularly where discretion is used to determine outcome.AI capabilities are currently being used in solutions in several agencies including: chatbots, virtual assistants and agents in service management document and image detection and recognition for border control and fraud detection data mapping to geographical areas free text recognition and translation entitlement calculation natural language processing.These applications represent various levels of risk both to the reputation of the agency, as well as individuals or business impacted by the decisions made or informed by the technology. Commonwealth entities looking to use AI systems in these areas should pay particular attention to the governance, risk, ethical, and legal implications of adoption and application of AI system.AI initiatives across the CommonwealthThe critical nature of AI and potential benefits to government has triggered a range of AI related initiatives and investigations happening throughout the Commonwealth. The DTA’s work on better structure and guidance for AI adoption in the public sector seeks to complement the broader whole of economy AI focuses on supporting Australian industries more generally. Both elements will continue to evolve as other longer-term AI specific initiatives underway across the Commonwealth progress over time.Some of these initiatives include: the Artificial Intelligence for Decision Making Initiative the Automated Decision Making and AI Regulation whitepaper the review of the Privacy Act 1998 the Royal Commission into the Robodebt Scheme.ObjectiveThe whole of government focus of this section is targeted specifically towards providing better structure to close the current gap in practical guidance within Government, for translating existing AI principles into practice. The information is intended to increase confidence to uptake AI in Australian Government agencies, through clarity on informing appropriate design, build and usage of AI technologies.It is critical that, as the public sector embraces these objectives, it is also recognised that with the opportunities that AI presents comes risk. AI is not infallible, and data inefficiencies and biases built into AI algorithms risk causing unintended harm at scale if they are not addressed and mitigated against. This standard should be consumed by entities considering AI to ensure that Australians are better able to trust that the technology will be used responsibly and safely by the Australian Government, and that AI promotes and improves inclusivity. It will be updated as necessary to ensure it remains consistent with the complementary Commonwealth-led workstreams, policies and legislation.AudienceThe primary audience for this information is members of the Australian Public Service who are engaged with the outputs of AI technologies to either inform activities or decisions, responsible for business processes or policy outcomes that are supported by AI technologies, responsible for decisions relating to the usage of AI technologies within an agency or who operate directly or indirectly in the technologies, for example: agency heads senior executives, decision makers and influencers who are responsible for the outcomes of policy decisions informed or assisted by AI technologies senior executives, decision makers and influencers who are responsible for the design and use of AI systems project leads and teams considering AI applications in their solutions operational leads and teams managing AI systems.This information can also be used by private sector stakeholders to better understand the expectations and requirements of public sector usage of AI technologies.Public Sector Adoption of AIGovernanceAppropriate governance structures are critical to achieving the ethical and responsible use of AI in a public sector context. Governance encompasses the system by which an organisation is controlled and operates, and the mechanisms by which it, and its people, are held to account. Ethics, risk management, compliance and administration, including meeting legal requirements, are all elements of governance.Initial ConsiderationsBefore adopting AI into a business process, agencies should consider: how the AI system will augment, change or even improve on existing approaches to delivering agency and whole of government outcomes whether AI is the most appropriate solution and if other non-AI and existing systems and processes could be explored.Decision-making and accountability hierarchiesExisting business owners and accountable decision makers, as opposed to information technology specialists, remain responsible for decisions assisted by machines and must understand both the inputs for the technologies within a process, and the outputs of the technologies within a process.For this reason, oversight of the development and maintenance of AI technologies must be incorporated into existing decision-making and accountability hierarchies that govern the output, risk and compliance elements of a Commonwealth entity’s core business, such as audit and risk committees, and not solely into ICT-specific governance arrangements.Governance bodies for AI technologies must have a reporting avenue to the Secretary, Agency Head or appropriate agency leadership body to review and accept the usage of these technologies and the way in which they support decision-making. Accordingly, these positions must have sufficient understanding of the way in which the technologies operate to inform that decision.Further, operational-level implementation should be driven by business or policy areas and supported by technologists, rather than being driven by the ICT areas of an entity. This is to ensure that the technology is implemented and maintained to support business and policy outcomes, as opposed to business and policy outcomes being driven by AI systems adoption.Agencies should also consider specific functions to support existing governance structures, including in specialist areas such as AI ethics, regulatory compliance and legal advice. These functions require a skill set that allows for consideration of the ramifications of a wide range of issues and must be positioned and at the appropriate level within an organisation to assert the level of influence required to inform decisions on the adoption, usage, review and maintenance of the technologies. Expertise within agencies that have mature AI applications presents an avenue to support knowledge transfer across the Australian Public Service (APS). Such knowledge transfer could occur, for example, as part of the Digital Profession.Risk ManagementRisk tolerances must be determined for each specific use case for AI technologies and align with existing risk management frameworks within each Agency. In assessing and managing risk associated with the adoption of the technologies, consideration should be given to assessing the varying risk tolerances across each specific use case, rather than in general terms for usage of the technology itself. These tolerances include for example, factors that are specific for each use case and should be considered independently of any prior adoption, such as requirements for accuracy, level of impact to existing process and potential impact to both internal and external outcomes. To achieve appropriate risk management, agencies should consider: how the appropriate human intervention points are to be embedded into the decision-making process; these intervention points will depend on the risk level, as well as the type of decision being aided by the AI, for example ensuring a human decision point in the process preceding any potential negative determination for a citizen or business an appropriate accountability structure to ensure the ongoing compliance of the use case with ethical and responsible AI usage; use cases must also meet existing legal requirements, particularly administrative law principles, privacy law and anti-discrimination law broader reputational risks that apply to public trust in government services; further information on this aspect is described in the Australian Data StrategyThe use of Risk Management FrameworksThe differences in risk tolerances for each use case and application of AI technologies inhibits the ability to adopt a universal risk management framework. Agencies should use risk management frameworks that are appropriate for the specific use cases and aligned to existing risk management approaches to assess and manage risks specific to AI systems. Several publicly available risk frameworks provide examples of how different applications can call for different approaches to risk management, for example: The NSW AI Assurance Framework is designed to assist agencies to design, build and use AI-enabled products and solutions. It is designed to help agencies identify risks that may be associated with their projects. New Zealand has the Algorithmic Charter for Aotearoa New Zealand that provides Charter signatories with a Risk Matrix to make an assessment of their algorithm decisions. This supports their evaluation, by quantifying the likelihood of an unintended adverse outcomes against its relative level of impact to derive an overall level of risk. Canada has the Directive on Automated Decision Making, that imposes a number of requirements, primarily related to risk management, on the federal government’s use of automated decision systems. This Directive is targeted at instances where artificial intelligence is used to make, or assist in making, administrative decisions. Agencies might also their own risk management frameworks and processes which meet agency specific requirements. However, agencies will need to ensure that these risk management frameworks and processes encompass AI specific risks and governance issues.Considerations for the Ethical adoption of AI technologiesAt a whole of economy level, Australia’s AI Ethics Principles released in 2019 are designed to ensure AI is safe, secure and reliable, as part of Australia’s broader AI Ethics Framework. It was developed alongside several existing and emerging initiatives, including the OECD Principles on AI which were endorsed by 42 countries, including Australia, and adopted by the G20. Australia’s eight AI Ethics Principles were codeveloped by CSIRO’s Data61 and the Department of Industry, Science and Energy (DISR), and help to: achieve safer, more reliable and fairer outcomes for all Australians reduce the risk of negative impact on those affected by AI applications businesses and governments to practice the highest ethical standards when designing, developing and implementing AI.The implementation of the AI Ethics Principles is a direct measure under the Australia’s AI Action Plan for making Australia a global leader in responsible and inclusive AI. The below guidance has been developed to assist agencies in the key considerations for applying these principles in a public sector context.There are eight ethics principles: Human societal and environmental wellbeing Human-centred values Fairness Privacy protection and security Reliability and safety Transparency and explainability Contestability Accountability.They help to: achieve safer, more reliable and fairer outcomes for all Australians reduce the risk of negative impact on those affected by AI applications businesses and governments to practice the highest ethical standards when designing, developing and implementing AI.This section builds on the AI Ethics Principles and their application in a public sector context.Human, societal and environmental wellbeingAI systems should benefit individuals, society and the environment. To incorporate human, societal and environmental wellbeing into the usage of AI technologies, agencies should: document a clear objective and reasonable justification for using AI technology determine that the development and use of AI delivers a clear public benefit and added value to the public consider whether the unintended consequences, secondary harms or benefits, and long-term impacts to the community have been documented; unintended consequences, secondary harm, and long-term negative impacts should be mitigated and prevented where possible conduct a risk assessment of potential risks against positive outcomes, which should be documented consider how the structures will be implemented to ensure than humans are able to maintain visibility of unintended consequences during design, implementation, and ongoing maintenance of the technologies.Human-centred valuesAI systems should respect human rights, diversity, and the autonomy of individuals. To incorporate human-centred values into the usage of AI technologies, agencies should consider: how the system may prevent the restriction of human rights, and how any impacts to human rights will be measured and mitigated how unlawful discrimination will be prevented. Under Australia’s federal anti-discrimination laws, it is unlawful to discriminate on the basis of a number of protected attributes, including age, disability, race, sex, intersex status, gender identity and sexual orientation. Unlawful discrimination could arise from how algorithms are written, from the use of non-diverse datasets in machine learning and from accessibility discrimination or digital exclusion. Australia’s anti-discrimination law (Attorney-General’s Department) and the human rights public sector guidance sheets (Attorney-General’s Department) provide additional information regarding discrimination. How user needs and their context for using a service will be understood and designed for as outlined in the Digital Service Standard (Digital Transformation Agency). the inclusion of subject matter experts who understand the ethical and legal implications of the decision or outcome in the design, audit and maintenance of AI applications how Disability discrimination (Attorney General’s Department and the Australian Human Rights Commission) will be addressed, and the use of assistive technology to assist people with hearing, visual and other impairments to engage with the AI systems. It is worth noting that failing to provide a reasonable adjustment to enable a person with a disability to engage with AI may constitute unlawful discrimination under federal law how to incorporate diversity throughout designing, developing and deploying AI to minimise the risk of missing important consideration, including how disability discrimination will be addressed.FairnessAI systems should be inclusive and accessible and should not involve or result in unfair discrimination against individuals, communities, or groups. To incorporate fairness into the usage of AI technologies, agencies should consider: ensuring that AI is accessible to those who need to use it engaging with people, communities and groups who will be impacted by the AI taking measures to ensure AI produced decisions minimise the risk of harmful bias and discrimination regularly evaluate the impacts of AI, iterating the technology and system to address any negative impacts reading the Commonwealth Ombudsman’s Automated Decision-making Better Practice Guide, which provides a practical tool for agencies and includes a checklist designed to assist managers and project officers during the design and implementation of new automated systems in administrative decision-making, and with ongoing assurance processes once a system is operational, will be incorporated into design and maintenance of AI enabled systems. the availability and assurance that data is of appropriate quality to support fair decisions that data governance and management practices ensure data is accurate, timely, complete, and consistent that data supporting AI technologies is fit for purpose, particularly noting usage of data collected for different purposes, and the reflection of biases in historical practices that risk being inherently ‘taught’ through machine learning. how human oversight in the decision-making process will be maintained the appropriate performance measures to calibrate the system.Privacy protection and securityAI systems should respect and uphold privacy rights and data protection and ensure the security of data to incorporate privacy protection and security into the usage of AI technologies, agencies should consider: how the application of AI technologies aligns with existing legal requirements that currently apply to government decision-making. These legal and policy requirements may include: Privacy Act 1988 (Cth). Australian Government agencies subject to the Privacy Act 1988 are required to conduct a privacy impact assessment (PIA) for all ‘high privacy risk projects’ under the Privacy (Australian Government Agencies – Governance) APP Code 2017. Data Availability and Transparency Act 2022 (Cth) Protective Security Policy Framework (PSPF) where applicable, appropriate management of Notifiable Data Breaches under Part IIIC of the Privacy Act 1988 ensuring that appropriate security measures are in place to manage potential security vulnerabilities ensuring that AI systems have the appropriate cyber security measures in place and are resilient against cyber-attacks. how the compounded risks associated with AI and the storage of cumulative data will be assessed, documented, and agreed by the appropriate decision maker within an agency whether they have obligations under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Cth) (FOI Act) relating to proactive publication of information in accordance with the Information Publication Scheme. It is also considered best practice to publish information about automation, as this is in line with the objectives of the FOI Act and helps foster public trust in government data-handling. how decision makers will agree to an appropriate risk of theft and exposure of data in AI applicationsReliability and safetyAI systems should reliably operate in accordance with their intended purpose. To incorporate reliability into the usage of AI technologies, agencies should consider: the methods of monitoring to recognise and remediate degradation in AI system performance over time, including through the use of a traceability matrix identifying performance metrics to complying with the agreed standard for the technology application the intended use of AI technology is operating in accordance with relevant federal, state or territory legislation undertaking regular monitoring and testing to check AI technologies and systems are meeting their intended purpose; and completing appropriate testing in line with standards and laws to ensure the system is safe.Transparency and ExplainabilityA good administrative apparatus is important for government agencies. To incorporate explainability into the usage of AI technologies, agencies should consider: the way in which meaningful information will be provided about the AI application, which: fosters a general understanding of the AI system with a clear rationale for the decision-making process. is communicated in a way that is easily understood. makes people aware of their interactions with AI systems; and enables those affected by AI systems to understand the outcome and the machine-assisted contributions supporting the outcome. how digital and ICT sourcing processes will be best used to ensure understanding of the inner workings of industry products and services how the purpose, operation, and contribution of AI to an overall process will be articulated in clear and understandable language to non-technical audiences, by: being transparent by letting people know, where appropriate, that their personal information is being used for or that they are interacting with an AI system clearly explaining how a decision was informed or aided by AI within what is technically possible. Where lawful or legitimate restrictions do not prevent this, this may include: documentation describing the purpose and broad functionality of the AI and how it is used making information about data and AI processes available. the approach to ensure that all technical and policy staff have appropriate support and training to create and maintain the technology application and understand the impact of its change on the overall processes it supports. the tools that will be used to provide meaningful information about the AI applications, including, for example: releasing to the public a risk analysis or profile of all AI machine-assisted decision-making systems creating evidence trails and or checklist of AI decisions creating a decisions register, which may be accessed by a member of the public through a Freedom of Information request. ContestabilityWhen an AI system significantly impacts a person, community, group or environment, there should be a timely process to allow people to challenge the use or outcomes of the AI system. To incorporate contestability into the usage of AI technologies, agencies should consider: the avenues and pathways for an individual or community to contest a decision, including the underlying data and process, including how a decision supported by the technologies can be appealed have communication channels and processes in place that allow users and stakeholders to provide feedback on AI systems the avenues to correct and record errors in decision-making by the AI application, and how best to communicate the avenues of redress to impacted individuals the extent to which information about the underlying technology applications, and algorithms, be made available to the public and other stakeholders structures for updating existing review processes and procedures to ensure their adequacy for the inclusion of AI technologies and assisted machine-assisted decision-making.Agencies should also make their own assessment as to whether they have obligations under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Cth) (FOI Act) relating to proactive publication of information in accordance with the Information Publication Scheme. It is also considered best practice to publish information about automation, as this is in line with the objectives of the FOI Act and helps foster public trust in government data-handling.AccountabilityPeople responsible for the different phases of the AI system lifecycle should be identifiable and accountable for the outcomes of the AI systems, and human oversight of AI systems should be enabled. To incorporate accountability into the usage of AI technologies, agencies should: consider how AI responsibilities will be included in agency accountability instruments and delegations. consider how delegates and senior executives accountable for decisions informed by AI will have the necessary skills to consider ethics in the decision-making process. ensure accurate and complete documentation and processes for the AI systems and their outcomes are available for external reviews and assurance engagements if necessary, and; have an appropriate level of human oversight for AI and decisions to protect the public.Further Reading Automated Decision-making Better Practice Guide (The Commonwealth Ombudsman) provides a practical tool for agencies and includes a checklist designed to assist managers and project officers during the design and implementation of new automated systems in administrative decision-making, and with ongoing assurance processes once a system is operational.

Internal interoperability via API functionality can increase productivity, efficiency, accuracy, and visibility, and enhance management reporting. External interoperability can provide access to government data and should be governed under a fair use policy, as well as in consideration of guidance aligned to capabilities.Use api.gov.au as a central resourceEntities must: apply the National API Design Standards (NAPIDS) hosted on API.gov.au to all Experience level APIs.Entities should: apply the NAPIDS to all Process Level APIs tailored for re-usability apply the NAPIDS to custom developed, System Level APIs to assist developing Process or Experience Level APIs if required utilise API.gov.au as a resource guiding all API development requirements.The standard does not apply to third-party system level APIs such as those available ‘out-of-the-box’ or as part of Software as a Service (SaaS) platform, e.g. Salesforce APIs or ArcGIS APIs. However, it may be applicable in circumstances where these Experience Level APIs are re-exposed for wider consumption.Understand the evolving API technology environmentEntities should: prioritise REST (Representational State Transfer) as the basis for design, noting its ‘core’ position as the de-facto mechanism of data representation and transfer to and from systems on the internet consider emerging alternatives such as GraphQL for streaming data or function-based APIs, where REST APIs typically are not suitable avoid implementation of outdated/superseded API types such as SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) retire/replace older API types such as SOAP where they are presently in use monitor emerging trends when developing API solutions.Recent shifts in the API architecture and design have included the evolution of API gateways from proprietary, supplier owned and managed interfaces to open-sourced alternatives offered at little or no cost. These offerings reduce implementation cost and provide greater flexibility in interconnecting other APIs and systems.API design is evolving to incorporate the segmentation of API data functionality into either control streams or pure data, ensuring the optimisation of data flow through the API. The technology movement in both API domains provide an opportunity for Commonwealth entities to enhance interoperability, reduce implementation costs and optimise data transfer functionality. There is also a recent trend towards direct incorporation of Machine Learning and Large Language Model systems that will be inherently dependent on API connectivity.Lower development and maintenance complexityEntities should: ensure that their selected solution is supportable, affordable, secure, and fit-for-purpose consider the suitability of low-code / no-code development paths prior to the use of more contemporary API development approaches.API solutions can be implemented using a low-code/no-code development approach that uses human-centred functionality to rapidly define, test, integrate, and present complex processes and rulesets in a modular and repeatable manner, with minimal use of programming languages.Contemporary API solutions adopting a low-code / no-code approach can benefit from the removal of layers between an analyst’s expertise and the solution. Direct engagement between the analyst and the platform can help optimise the end-to-end process or integrate the needs of a stakeholder. Benefits of this approach include rapid development, a better-understood and more refined business process and enhanced stakeholder satisfaction.Determine an API release, fair use, and distribution strategyEntities must: define and document an API release, fair use and distribution strategy control and document release and distribution on a per-API basis.Entities should: ensure a transparent approach to the release of APIs, around fair and reasonable use of the API and access to all associated data provide clear guidance on how APIs may be made available, including any supply costs.Commonwealth entities have invested in the substantial development of system APIs. Some of these may be used internally as patterns, supplied to other entities for systems interconnection or released externally for third party interfaces. API owners have a discretion as to how, and to whom, they release APIs.Adhere to reuse principlesThe Australian Government Architecture provides information for entities on Reuse.Entities must: meet the requirements of the Digital and ICT Reuse Policy ensure that their selected solution, irrespective of reuse of existing investment, is supportable, affordable, secure, and fit-for-purpose through continual improvement of processes, and features, data, security, technology, skills, and cost check the contractual arrangements, Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) currency, and AGA design state prior to investment.Entities should: compare their requirements with those of other comparable entities and system functions, and seek to reuse learnings from preceding implementations consider specific functional and non-functional requirements prior to solution design or consideration of technology choice, including: volume and nature of information assets broader system purpose performance and availability requirements privacy/sensitivity concerns discover existing designs on the AGA website, on api.gov.au, through direct contact with entities with comparable use cases, or via existing whole-of-government (WofG) procurement arrangements.","exactTitle":"Application programming interfaces (APIs)"},{"id":"24","title":"Application programming interfaces (APIs)","excerpt":"Explore Application programming interfaces (APIs) resources\n","description":"","url":"/capability/application-programming-interfaces/resources/","domain":"","type":"Resources list","subtype":"","content":"Explore Application programming interfaces (APIs) resourcesPattern ABS Data API (Beta) ABS Indicator API Standard API.gov.auSystem Integrated Regulatory Information System (IRIS)","exactTitle":"Application programming interfaces (APIs)"},{"id":"25","title":"Application security","excerpt":"Explore Application security resources\n","description":"","url":"/capability/application-security/resources/","domain":"","type":"Resources list","subtype":"","content":"Explore Application security resourcesSystem Integrated Regulatory Information System (IRIS)","exactTitle":"Application security"},{"id":"26","title":"Application security","excerpt":"The Australian Government ensures the safety and security of its operations to remain a trusted custodian of sensitive information.

As such, early adoption by agencies should be considered with caution, and only once the identified security risks and vulnerabilities are addressed before implementation. Furthermore, integration approaches may also require significant vendor commitment to build compatible servers and connectors than relying on native (i.e. direct, built-in) system integrations.

The DTA does not currently hold a formal position on the use of Blockchain technology.This case study was published to complement the “do you need blockchain?” guide, providing high-level guidance for Commonwealth government entities considering the adoption of blockchain technology.The Australian Taxation Office ran a hackathon to increase transparency around Luxury Car Tax compliance and used blockchain to validate the dealer history of cars.What problem were you trying to solve?We ran a Hackathon to see if we could create a prototype to help increase transparency around LCT (Luxury Car Tax) compliance and assist other government authorities and car dealerships in helping in tracking vehicle ownership details.How did use of a blockchain help solve this problem?Blockchain was used to ensure data entered by car dealers was not later tampered with. Also we used it as a shared data-store so that car dealerships, state road authorities and customs can track ownership of a luxury vehicle throughout its lifespan.Did you consider existing data exchange and centralised database technologies?It is likely a centralised database may have achieved the desired technology properties in conjunction with the use of hash trees, though the experiment was intended to help us better understand blockchain technology.What brought you to blockchain?Blockchain was originally brought to our attention from external hype generated within the IT vendor community. In 2018, we were offered an opportunity to engage in an experiment facilitated by Microsoft, alongside Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) and the Digital Transformation Agency (DTA), to participate in a Blockchain Development Hackathon.What went well?In one week we built a prototype blockchain solution. The solution worked and proved to be a useful communication tool in helping raise awareness of blockchain technology throughout the agency.What surprised you?Immaturity of development tools and technology provided to develop the prototype, and high potential hosting and operational costs (if used in a production environment).What do you know now that you didn’t know earlier?We now have a better understanding of what problems should be solved using blockchain technology. For use within a regulatory context, overall maturity of blockchain will need to improve significantly.What advice would you pass on to other government agencies?Don’t shy away from experimenting or exploring the use of blockchain within your core business, however always be mindful of the hype which currently surrounds it. We also recommend maintaining a healthy dose of scepticism regarding any claims of future revolutionary impact.Solving a problem using a blockchain will primarily involve fundamental business change, coupled with addressing the challenge associated with the state of its technology maturity. There are also other external factors to contend with such as privacy, lack of governing principles, standards and other change management issues which will need to be understood and formally addressed across multiple levels of government before you will start to see real benefits.AGA Code: DES184Type: DesignLinked to: CAP59","exactTitle":"Blockchain case study: Australian Taxation Office luxury car tax compliance"},{"id":"60","title":"Blockchain case study: Commonwealth Bank and the NDIS","excerpt":"Details\n","description":"This guide was last updated in 2018 and should be considered as outdated pending further revision on Blockchain capability in 2026.

The DTA does not currently hold a formal position on the use of Blockchain technology.This case study was published to complement the “do you need blockchain?” guide, providing high-level guidance for Commonwealth government entities considering the adoption of blockchain technology.The National Disability Insurance Scheme trialled combining blockchain with the New Payments Platform to create smart money.What problem were you trying to solve?We looked at solving problems with 3 sets of users: For NDIS participants, simplifying the user experience by eliminating paperwork, manual calculations, paper receipts and service eligibility considerations. For NDIS service providers, reducing administration costs by enabling simple eligibility checks, near real-time payments and automatic reconciliation. For the government, enabling improved value for money through enhanced service delivery and fraud control powered by data analytics capabilities.How did use of a blockchain help solve this problem?The proof of concept translates budgets in participant’s NDIS plans into blockchain tokens. Smart contracts (which represent the budget rules) are dynamically attached to the blockchain tokens to form smart money (programmed to know who it can be spent by, what it can be spent on and when it can be spent). This enables NDIS participants, service providers and the government to have real-time visibility of service eligibility, with appropriate access controls for privacy. Furthermore, service providers could redeem the tokens they receive as they deliver services for near real-time payment on Australia’s New Payments Platform.Did you consider existing data exchange and centralised database technologies?Yes, our report evaluated the proof of concept against a hypothesised centralised database solution. We found that a centralised database and our smart money proof of concept could achieve a similar front-end user experience. While the smart money proof of concept could offer potential platform advantages on the back-end, if the smart money technology was applied across multiple payment environments (that is, to the NDIS and other use cases), further work may be required to deliver sufficient performance and confidentiality outcomes to achieve these platform benefits.What brought you to blockchain?CBA and CSIRO’s Data61 had wanted to test the potential of blockchain to enable smart money for quite a while. We were also interested to see how blockchain technology may be able to integrate with existing payments technologies, such as Australia’s New Payments Platform. The NDIS contains highly personalised budgets and payments, making it a good case study for our project.What went well?The smart money proof of concept could enable all the conditions in the NDIS ecosystem, including different types of budget management (self-management, agency-management and plan-management). We received great feedback from NDIS participants and carers on our prototype app (Net Promoter Score rating of 89%).What surprised you?One of the biggest surprises was the extent of the challenge to collect all the data required to enable conditional payments across the NDIS ecosystem, including payments to general businesses that deliver services to NDIS participants (for example, travel, digestive aids). The design challenge is as much about effective data collection as it is about data processing (whether using blockchain or a centralised database).What do you know now that you didn’t know earlier?That blockchain technology offers promise, particularly around the potential for platform benefits if the technology is leveraged across multiple conditional payment environments – but that further work is required to balance 2 key design criteria: performance and confidentiality.What advice would you pass on to other government agencies?Collaborate with the Digital Transformation Agency and other government and industry stakeholders related to your use case, so that you can benefit from a range of perspectives and expertise. User research with existing users of government schemes is also invaluable and should be central to your design considerations.Access the reportThe Commonwealth Bank of Australia website hosts the Making Money Smart (Empowering NDIS participants with Blockchain technologies) report (full text) and the Making Money Smart (companion document).AGA Code: DES185Type: DesignLinked to: CAP59","exactTitle":"Blockchain case study: Commonwealth Bank and the NDIS"},{"id":"61","title":"Blockchain overview: Australian Government guide","excerpt":"Details\n","description":"This guide was last updated in 2019 and should be considered as outdated, pending further revision on Blockchain capability in 2026.

As part of the guide, we have referenced research carried out by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which is part of the Department of Commerce in the United States.Our research into blockchain supports the findings of the Blockchain Technology Overview, published by the US Government’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Rather than duplicate the NIST publication, we have developed the guidance below to help interested government organisations localise NIST’s advice for the Australian context.In Australia, the conversation around blockchain tends to promote its short-term potential, reflecting NIST’s observation that:“… the technology is not well understood. It is not magical; it will not solve all problems. As with all new technology, there is a tendency to want to apply it to every sector in every way imaginable.” (p. iv)It is also common for blockchain’s advocates to overlook its limitations, especially around important questions of governance:“…there are operational and governance issues that affect the behavior of the network. For example, in permissioned blockchain networks… there are design issues surrounding what entity or entities will operate and govern the network for the intended user base.” (p. v)Blockchain is only one of a number of data storage and exchange solutions, and other proven alternatives are ready for immediate use. Depending on the business needs, using more mature solutions allows agencies to move beyond the experimentation or prototyping to real-world applications.We recommend agencies focus on the problem they are facing before applying any solution, including blockchain:Blockchain technology is still new and should be investigated with the mindset of “how could blockchain technology potentially benefit us?” rather than “how can we make our problem fit into the blockchain technology paradigm?”. Organisations should treat blockchain technology like they would any other technological solution at their disposal and use it in appropriate situations. (p. vi)Governance and ownershipAgencies must understand the governance arrangements of any proposed blockchain.There are additional risks and considerations when using permissioned consortium blockchains, where leading users often in effect control the blockchain. This usually removes the perceived benefits of decentralisation.“The governance of blockchain networks deals with the rules, practices and processes by which the blockchain network is directed and controlled. A common misconception is that blockchain networks are systems without control and ownership. The phrase “no one controls a blockchain!” is often exclaimed.” (p. 35)“For permissioned blockchain networks, control and governance is driven by members of the associated owner or consortium. The consortium can govern who can join the network, when members are removed from the network, coding guidelines for smart contracts, etc.” (p. 35)TrustWhile agencies may find blockchain’s claimed ability to exchange data with low-trust external organisations attractive, it is important to remember that it is not a “trustless” system. Users still need to trust the technology itself, the software developers, the dispute mediation process, and the behaviour of other users. Should that trust be misplaced, there is little recourse for agencies trying to use blockchain to create new and innovative solutions to problems.Another common misinterpretation comes from people hearing that there is no “trusted third party” in a blockchain and assuming blockchain networks are “trustless” environments. While there is no trusted third party certifying transactions in permissionless blockchain networks (in permissioned systems it is less clear, as administrators of those systems act as an administrator of trust by granting users admission and permissions), there is still a great deal of trust needed to work within a blockchain network. (p. 38)Encryption and accessAgencies should pay particular consideration to the blockchain’s use of encryption. Blockchains are not encrypted by default and the data is available to all users, whether users within the network – in the case of private blockchains, or the broader public – for public blockchains. There are permissioned blockchains which can restrict some access, however conventionally speaking, data is not encrypted by default.Correcting errorsBlockchains are by definition append-only. This means users can only add data to the blockchain, not edit or delete existing data. This makes it impossible to completely erase incorrect data, in the way a database record can be changed or deleted.This may cause significant issues, for example, if sensitive personal details are misrecorded against the wrong person or if the need arises to delete someone’s personal details.Consider scenarios where data may be governed by policy or regulations (such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) regulations). Data such as this may or may not be appropriate to store even within a permissioned blockchain network. (p. 44)Agencies must consider how their processes and procedures can account for this new way of thinking: when it comes to blockchain implementations, mistakes, and their corrections, no matter how small or large, become available to all users with access. While in some cases this may be acceptable or even desirable, agencies must consider the possible risk to trust and agency reputation with this approach.Conclusion The DTA believes blockchain is still an emerging technology and agencies should be pragmatic when assessing its applications. The DTA supports agencies in finding new and innovative responses to challenges and blockchain may be part of future solutions. Agencies should objectively compare blockchain solutions to alternative technologies when solving business problems. The limitations of blockchain should be carefully weighed against any unique benefits provided by a blockchain-specific solution for government. Agencies should focus on the problems they need to solve, rather than start from a specific technology solution. Agencies should continue to monitor blockchain developments, looking for opportunities to enhance service delivery that this technology may unlock in the future.Further readingBlockchain technology overview (NIST)This paper provides strategic advice for executives who are increasingly expected to have a position on what blockchain may mean for their organisation.

This promotes consistency and streamlines processes across entities.Lower development and maintenance complexity of business process and workflow solutionsBusiness process and workflow solutions can often be implemented through low-code/no-code platform solutions. These solutions use human-centred functionality to rapidly define, test, integrate, and present complex processes and rulesets in a modular and repeatable manner, with minimal use of programming languages.

This can be achieved through regular updates and strategic meetings, as well as through detailed reporting, such as real-time dashboards that provide insights into key performance metrics and operational challenges. Finance teams need to identify the budget owners, forecast the costs for each budget owner, and monitor the actual versus predicted costs on a regular basis. Product owners need to forecast and track the cloud costs related to their product, and account for those costs within the profit and loss. They need to understand the business changes that can impact their predicted costs, and track value metrics to ensure they are getting an efficient service. IT leadership need to ensure that the cloud FinOps strategy is incorporated into the cloud strategy and ensure an effective cloud FinOps service. They need to establish optimisation priorities, define technical controls and processes, so that they can track the trends, identifying and responding to any anomalous costs. Engineering teams need to be aware of their service costs and have defined routes for the technical optimisation of their services. They need to be alerted to irregular or unplanned costs and either take corrective action or communicate the changes and their value. The running cost needs to be considered as part of the design process when developing or refreshing systems to enable optimum design decisions.The needs of stakeholders should be realised via clear and traceable requirements, that are maintained as fundamental to further implementation works.Comply with legislationWhen establishing cloud FinOps practices, entities should ensure legislative compliance and embed visibility and legislative traceability into the operating model itself. This approach ensures compliance and legislative alignment is core to all cloud deployments and makes audits efficient.Any domain-specific legislation relevant to the context of the entity/cloud investment should be considered alongside core pieces of legislation including the: Archives Act 1983 (Cth) Data Availability and Transparency (DAT) Act 2002 (Cth) Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (Cth)Research and assess practices and solutionsAll entities should conduct their own requirements gathering and follow an objective assessment of platform suitability utilising whole-of-government (WofG) procurement panels, guidance and tool kits.Researching and assessing cloud FinOps solutions is crucial, particularly as this is an emerging capability in which vendor offerings are also rapidly evolving. Thorough research allows entities to understand the diverse range of solutions and tools available, helping to make informed decisions to optimise cost management, enhance resource utilisation and compatibility with existing systems.Incrementally improve strategiesEntities should incrementally establish a central cloud FinOps function to provide coordination and information between stakeholders involved in cloud operations. Making multiple small scale, quick actions with limited scope allows FinOps teams to assess the outcomes of their actions, and gain insights into the value of taking further action.Reuse previous investmentEntities should seek to reuse existing investment where suitable, and prudentially consider whether the efficacy of a given implementation method will meet entity needs. When selecting a cloud FinOps model, tool, or platform for reuse, entities should: understand their use-case specific functional and non-functional requirements, including volume and nature of data, broader system purpose, performance matters, and privacy/sensitivity concerns consider existing and future technological landscape and interoperability needs investigate previous investment within your entity and across government and seek to reuse where suitable ensure any investment is contemporary and viable for long-term use.If existing options in the capability are not suitable, consideration should be given to the reusability of relevant processes and practices derived from related AGA capabilities.There are several existing governance frameworks developed for other AGA capabilities, that may lend themselves to developing cloud FinOps policies and practices. Entities may also explore the FinOps Framework, established by the FinOps Foundation, which provides an operating model that it considers a baseline for establishing excellent FinOps practice.Build for reuse and the long-term useDeveloping a cloud FinOps system with broad applicability across entities, and a future-focus that enables long term support and viability, is critical for reducing risk, increasing efficiency, and supporting consistent implementation across government.Any new system should be designed with a modular and scalable architecture, allowing for future integration into other structures. Emphasising interoperability and standardisation, in both technologies and data formats, ensures adaptability across different entities. Additionally, user-friendly interfaces and comprehensive documentation should be incorporated to facilitate ease of implementation and use. This will allow for a streamlining of processes, promoting and fostering consistency across entities and aligning with best practice in non-government organisations.","exactTitle":"Cloud FinOps"},{"id":"90","title":"Cloud Financial Optimisation (Cloud FinOps)","excerpt":"This policy describes the requirements for entities planning digital investments and adopting cloud financial optimisation practices and solutions.

It has the potential to enhance collaboration, limit the duplication of solutions and reduce maintenance effort. This allows entities to refocus that effort into improving digital service delivery.It is critical this standard be considered alongside those of complementary capabilities: Cloud Financial Operations Information Asset Management Information Asset SecurityComply with legislationEntities must: comply with relevant Commonwealth legislation including (but not limited to): Archives Act 1983 (Cth) Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Cth) Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) comply with any other legislation applicable to specific functions and circumstances.Align to guidelines and standardsEntities must: meet the Hosting Certification Framework (please refer to Hosting for more information) apply the principles and requirements of the Protective Security Policy Framework throughout their organisation, including in the context of cloud computing facilities and services.Entities should: apply a risk-based approach to cyber security, where it comes to cloud, to align with the Information Security Manual (ISM) utilise applicable elements of the ASD’s Cloud Security Guidance Suite, including the Blueprint for Secure Cloud - an online tool to support the design, configuration, and deployment of collaborative and secure cloud and hybrid workspaces develop a risk-managed approach to treat the risk of a cloud service (including backups of data) becoming inaccessible for any reason (e.g. company failure, legal dispute, etc.), including concepts such as contingency backups outside of the main cloud service.Develop a cloud strategyEntities should: develop a cloud strategy to provide a roadmap for transitioning to the cloud, outlining the steps for migrating applications and data, optimising resource utilisation, and managing costs effectively develop a cloud policy optimised for business outcomes, including speed, resilience, and agility, and aligned with supporting guardrails around data, security, governance and architecture develop and update implementation plans for ongoing cloud activities.Incrementally adopt cloud computing servicesEntities should: begin their cloud journeys with low complexity services that do not contain any sensitive data, and progressively mature their approach prioritise, for any ICT investment, cloud-native and modern application architecture design patterns adopt applications which are secure, resilient, flexible, modular, automated, and interoperable consider the appropriate service model for their needs, of: Platform as a Service (PaaS) Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) Software as a Service (SaaS) Everything as a Service (or Anything as a Service) (XaaS) Function as a Service (FaaS) regularly review their cloud performance against strategic goals and standards, and make alterations proactively rather than responsively.Avoid functional customisation by using cloud services ‘as they come’Entities should: map the present state business needs requirements identify where these data models, processes, and other requirements would not be met by a cloud service as-offered prioritise standardising business functions/processes to those aligned to cloud offerings, in particular where these are vendor-agnostic conventions, in preference to customising service functions where customisations are unavoidable, ensure they are made in a manner that is maintainable, scalable, and reusable.Automate where suitableEntities should: automate where possible to reduce the manual effort associated with provisioning, configuring, and managing cloud solutions when developing or procuring services, ensure application, data, and messaging services can take advantage of cloud automation ensure a strict quality assurance process is applied to any automation activities.Take a risk-based approach to cloud securityEntities should: ensure assurance and risk management activities are included in the cloud strategy and considered throughout all stages of deployment, utilisation, and decommissioning undertake a risk assessment prior to any new implementations, or alterations, to understand and meet the security requirements of a cloud computing service consider using threat modelling, a family of activities for improving security by identifying threats, and then defining countermeasures to prevent, or mitigate the effects of, threats to the system apply relevant security policy and guidance, factoring in cloud specific considerations to set the right controls, mitigations, and determining accepted risk apply only necessary controls, to avoid inadvertent restriction of services leverage the following guidance from the Australian Cyber Security Centre: The Anatomy of a Cloud Assessment and Authorisation Cloud Security Assessment Report Template Cloud Security Controls Matrix Cloud Assessment and Authorisation – Frequently Asked Questions Cloud Computing Security for Tenants Monitor the health and usage of services in real timeEntities should: ensure that their cloud service provider can provide metrics that support the forecasting and analytics needs of the entity control costs of cloud use through provisioning and scaling on demand proactively monitor the health and status of the cloud services implement a resource tagging strategy to enable cohesive handling of the above points.Recognise emerging cloud computing trendsEntities should: monitor emerging trends in cloud computing consider the applicability of emerging trends to their needs, and factor this into their cloud strategy.Emerging trends include: Hybrid multi-cloud environments, can offer more customised and flexible solutions using public cloud services from different cloud services providers, allowing easier movement across different cloud infrastructures. This increases adaptability and reduces the risk of vendor lock-in. However, this approach can also add complexity, and raise the chance of misconfigurations, insecure interfaces, and other security breaches. Edge computing which reduces latency, optimises bandwidth, and enhances privacy and security through balancing cloud operations with a degree of localised data processing. It offers scalability and flexibility by distributing workloads more efficiently and ensures resilience and reliability in scenarios with intermittent connectivity. Cost effectiveness may also be achieved by minimising data transfer and storage needs in the cloud, particularly benefiting data intensive applications, however this is at the cost of potentially increased complexity and cost of maintenance of local and cloud infrastructures. Sustainability in cloud computing is gaining attention. Entities should monitor for new processes, capabilities and tools, aimed at the monitoring and management of energy consumption and carbon emissions for workloads deployed on cloud.Procure via the Cloud MarketplaceEntities should: procure cloud services, include technical, advisory, professional, managed and project services, through the DTA’s Cloud Marketplace select a Cloud Service Provider (CSP) in consideration of: what level of data is being accessed where is it hosted who has access evaluate public cloud computing services before considering private or hybrid cloud solutions leverage the most scalable, flexible, and cost-effective solutions available ensure that the public cloud service has a level of security appropriate for the classification of information that is to be handled.Adhere to reuse principlesThe Australian Government Architecture provides information for entities on Reuse.Entities should: compare their requirements with those of other comparable entities and system functions, and seek to reuse learnings from preceding implementations consider specific functional and non-functional requirements prior to solution design or consideration of technology choice, including: volume and nature of information assets broader system purpose performance and availability requirements privacy/sensitivity concerns meet the requirements of the Digital and ICT Reuse Policy.","exactTitle":"Cloud computing"},{"id":"94","title":"Cloud computing","excerpt":"Other government directions\nYou may need to meet specific requirements within these whole-of-government resources.

This enables entities to acquire the knowledge and insights vital for fostering stronger relationships with both individuals and businesses.Comply with legislation and regulationEntities must: comply with relevant Commonwealth legislation including (but not limited to): Archives Act 1983 (Cth) Data Availability and Transparency (DAT) Act 2002 (Cth) Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Cth) Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), including the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) comply with any other legislation applicable to specific functions and circumstances.Entities should: seek independent legal advice where appropriate.Align to guidelines and standardsEntities must: meet the Hosting Certification Framework (please refer to Hosting for more information) for hosting of CRM platforms apply the principles and requirements of the Protective Security Policy Framework throughout their organisation, including in the context of CRM.Entities should: apply a risk-based approach to cyber security, where it comes to CRM systems, to align with the Information Security Manual (ISM) develop a risk-managed approach to treat the risk of a CRM service (including backups of data) becoming inaccessible for any reason, or of data within it being lost or compromised.Align to CRM archetypesEntities should: align their use cases to archetypes as defined below use archetype alignment as a focal point for identification of previous investment and assessment of solution suitability lead any investment in CRM with a holistic service management and delivery approach in alignment with the entity’s overarching mission.Across government, CRM systems can be grouped based on their broader roles in government operations and service delivery. Specific use cases can be broadly categorised into the following archetypes: Government-to-individual: Systems for overseeing and engaging with verified individuals and their data, generally for the purpose of individual access to government services. Government-to-business: Systems designed to manage and interact with verified business representatives and their data generally for the purpose of access to government services. Government-to-government: Systems created to facilitate interactions with authenticated government officials for fulfilling reporting obligations or delivering shared services. Government-to-partner: Systems created to facilitate interaction with other external companies and partners, such as suppliers/vendors and industry networks.In addition to considering the CRM archetype it is important to consider scale of the CRM system. Entities should: consider three dimensions of scale: Data volume: The total amount of data be maintained in both accessible and archive states. Interaction volume: How often interactions are created, updated, and accessed, including an annual average alongside understanding of peaks and troughs (significant spikes due to external factors, such as financial, fiscal or political cycles). Size of the user base: The number of users of the system and their access requirements. utilise system scale to test comparability of potential solutions, and with previous investment across government.Adopt a customer-centric approach to designing CRM systemsEntities must: meet the requirements for designing and delivering digital government services set by the Digital Service Standard determine and monitor appropriate performance and experience metrics in line with the Digital Performance Standard.Entities should: understand the business issues that CRM systems need to resolve, and their importance, to shape requirements prior to investigating technological solutions communicate initial assumptions, seeking varied viewpoints from stakeholders and customers, and utilise existing data and resources as well as undertaking external research explicitly outline the risks associated with both acting and remaining inactive, identify the impacts, highlight possible obstacles, and acknowledge any gaps in data and knowledge in managing customer relationships ensure CRM systems and solutions can cater for growth and changing preferences without impacting performance, functionality, or stability baseline metrics via initial assessments of customer experience, then continually monitor in order to make informed decisions on future improvements design with foresight to upholding principles such as net neutrality, uncensored information access, and the freedom of online assembly, evaluating how the use of CRM system could affect users’ digital rights.Determine needs within an extended set of CRM featuresEntities should: investigate their entity/project specific needs align where suitable to the below considerations when determining potential CRM solutions.A series of extended CRM considerations includes: Automation of engagements: Can the solution automate customer engagements, either directly or through integration with other systems? Case management: Does the solution include case management functionality or integrate with case management systems? Case Management | aga (digital.gov.au) Collaboration: Does the solution enable employee collaboration within a workflow to seamlessly deliver services to customers? Collaboration and Sharing | aga (digital.gov.au) Modularity: Can the solution operate as an independent component while also integrating seamlessly into the broader business process? Digital engagement: Does the solution support a range of digital engagement channels? Low-code development: Does the solution support simplified development, allowing effort to be placed on building business processes, and/or one step deployment? Platform ecosystem integration: Is the solution interoperable with third party functional modules? Workflow and business process management support: Does the solution support interaction with business process and workflow management solutions?Ensure the security of government and customersCRM solutions may involve handling, managing, and communicating sensitive data, and the risk of inadvertent access or damage must be managed.Entities must: authenticate users and customers prior to any information access, alteration, or exchange. gather only the data required for specific, defined purposes, as excessive data collection can compromise privacy and security.Entities should: acquire explicit and informed permission from individuals and businesses before collecting or using their data transparently offer clear, accessible privacy policies in simple language, helping customers make informed choices about their data utilise the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) APP guidelines to assist in applying the APPs when designing CRM solutions take a zero-trust approach to the providing of information to both customers and officials, ensuring that only relevant and necessary data is made available utilise the Trusted Digital Identity Framework (TDIF) Identity Exchange and Attribute Provider to enable identity authentication of individual and businesses.Prioritise integrationEntities must: enhance interoperability with Commonwealth entities and support data sharing within the bounds of legislation applicable to entities’ specific functions and circumstances.Entities should define a singular reference source of truth for key data points, ensuring that there cannot be conflicting information in different sources integrate CRM solutions with other systems through APIs, or other means, to boost productivity, efficiency, accuracy, and visibility of customer data and interactions across government ensure data synchronisation between CRMs and other systems in a controlled manner that maintains record consistency and reduces risks associated with data silos. integrate appropriate communication channels (such as digital portal messaging, email, SMS, and paper mail) to improve customer interactions align with API guidance to support cross-agency and jurisdictional data sharing, maintaining a consistent, reusable vocabulary consider data interoperability that enables the exchanging of data between different systems and entities using the DATA Scheme use current data, process, and virtual integration patterns, and develop new ones when needed, to improve collective APS skills across government.Monitor innovation and emerging trends in CRMCRM has traditionally been a mature and commoditized solution. Advancements in technology fields including Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Augmented/Virtual Reality are enabling previously impossible customer experiences by providing features like “next best actions”, or virtual delivery channels.Entities must: comply with the policy for responsible use of AI in government where there is AI involved at any point in a CRM solution.Entities should: consider opportunities to integrate emerging technologies, such as AI and virtual servicing, into CRM systems to enhance customer interactions, streamline processes, improve overall efficiency, and drive growth reflect on how data models, datasets, and algorithms within CRM could relate to entitlement decisions, aiming to offer users transparent information about the factors affecting these decisions.Adhere to reuse principlesFor further information on reuse, see the AGA’s Reuse standard.Entities should: consider CRM-specific functional and non-functional requirements prior to solution design or consideration of technology choice meet the requirements of the whole-of-government reuse policy source via the Digital Marketplace on BuyICT, including taking advantage of whole-of-government arrangements.","exactTitle":"Customer Relationship Management"},{"id":"109","title":"Customer Relationship Management","excerpt":"This policy describes the requirements for entities planning digital investments involving Customer Relationship (CRM) platforms.

It helps government buyers use digital panels and enables new sellers to join panels more often. This policy is guided by principles that support a flexible government and an environment that fosters digital. The policy supports the Digital Sourcing Framework and delivers on the ICT Procurement Taskforce’s 2017 recommendation for the ‘immediate simplification of a range of ICT procurement practices for agencies, including reforms to ICT procurement panel arrangements’. To do this the policy aims to: modernise panels make panels easy to use for buyers and sellers improve access to emerging products and services reduce costs and duplication. The policy creates a panel certification scheme supported by eight principles. The certification scheme helps agencies to be recognised as digital sourcing leaders who provide panels that meet the modern expectations of buyers. These panels will attract more buyers and provide them with opportunities for buying the latest technology. Having certified panels will help agencies attract interest from sellers who are seeking a better experience when selling to government.

Corporate Commonwealth entities may choose to apply the policy. The policy is designed for new and updated digital and ICT multi-supplier panels, with two or more sellers. Updated panels refer to any of the following scenarios: opening a panel to new sellers any change to categories, terms, head agreements exercising extension options making substantial changes to a panel.

Applicability The Digital Sourcing Consider First Policy is effective from 1 July 2019. The policy applies to Non-Corporate Commonwealth Entities, as defined by the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 , and may be leveraged by other Commonwealth entities and companies. This policy must be applied to any investment in digital products and/or services with an expected or realised whole-of-life cost of $80,000 or greater (GST inclusive). The procurement threshold is $80,000 (GST Inclusive) at Paragraph 9.7a of the Commonwealth Procurement Rules . If the threshold is changed, this policy will automatically apply the new threshold. Agencies are still encouraged to apply the policy for each investment below $80,000 (GST inclusive). The policy must be used during the identification of business needs and before making any investment decisions (prior to sourcing, building or re-using a digital product and/or service). The policy does not replace other evaluation requirements. Access the policy The buyict.gov.au website hosts the Digital sourcing consider first policy (full text).

The DTA does not currently hold a formal position on the use of Blockchain technology.The “do you need blockchain?” guide provided high-level guidance for Commonwealth government entities considering the adoption of blockchain technology.How to decide whether you should invest in blockchain.We based these questions on a blockchain decision tree developed by the US Department of Homeland Security and published by the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST). We’ve made changes to suit an Australian Government context, and included some information about public and private blockchains.Do you have multiple peers who need to share and write to the same data store?For example, an agency is assessing the merit of a common data store for supply chain data. Customs authorities, shipping companies and freight forwarders all use this data.Blockchain requires more than two peers who need to share and write to the same database. If your use case doesn’t have this requirement, it is worth considering a conventional database.Once you write your records, are they never updated or deleted?For example, an agency may record a transaction against the incorrect welfare participant in a blockchain. This error could only be fixed by appending another, correct record, rather than updating or deleting the original and incorrect record.If you need to update or delete, rather than add to, records, such as a requirement to delete personal information, conventional databases are probably a better solution, however there are options using append-only data storage.Will you add sensitive identifiers to the data store?Blockchain data is open by default. Even if the blockchain has a set of permissioned users, sensitive records, such as medical records, could be at risk. While a person’s identity may not be attached, given the immutability of blockchain, unique data patterns and attributes could, in time, disclose their identity.Using blockchains for sensitive or in-confidence data presents risks for public sector agencies that require careful considerations. Although some permissioned blockchain protocols allow a concept known as channels to restrict access to specific groups, encrypted databases with secure data exchange are well understood and offer a less risky approach.Is it difficult for network peers to decide who should control the data store?For example, it may be hard for a group of nations to decide who should house a centralised data store for sensitive nuclear accounting data.If there is a clear lead organisation or peer who is trusted to control the data store and able to settle disputes and maintain the rules of the network, a conventional database may be a better solution.If agencies can implement appropriate governance arrangements, including the need to mediate disputes and the implications of the control of blockchain, then a blockchain solution may be viable.Note: in many instances a blockchain requires a single entity or a formal governance arrangement to control and administer the network. This may remove any benefits from data decentralisation.Do you want a tamper-evident log of all writes to the data store?For example, the Australian Government may benefit from the ability to prove, through audit, that historical scientific records have not been altered.Blockchains, just like append-only logs used by entities such as certificate transparency logs, keep a record of all changes to the data. This provides for greater data integrity, but this benefit should be considered against the other requirements of the solution.Is there a benefit from removing intermediaries?For example, cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, rely on the permissionless blockchain protocol to facilitate exchange of money without needing a bank. Such protocols typically use consensus models, such as ‘Proof of Work’, to remove the need for an intermediary. This is known as a ‘disintermediation benefit’.Undertaking a proof-of-concept can help uncover possible disintermediation benefits for your use case. On the other hand, if removing intermediaries would prevent your organisation from exercising its statutory authority, then conventional data storage may be more appropriate.Public blockchainA public blockchain allows anyone to interact with the network. By design, these blockchains are decentralised, giving authority to anyone who can demonstrate effective control over the networks.As a result, when implementing public blockchains, you are effectively providing a permissionless and publicly accessible data publishing and storage solution, with no control over the data once published.You should also consider that many of the blockchain operators may reside outside of Australia’s jurisdiction and are anonymous, which may lead to increased data privacy and security risks.If agencies can demonstrate a requirement to prove published data has not been altered, then the concepts of hashing, Merkle trees and widely witnessed media can be used to prove data integrity. These technologies and concepts form the basis of blockchain.When considering publishing of datasets for public use, we recommend the use of data.gov.au.Private blockchainIf you meet all of the criteria above, you might consider a private, or permissioned, blockchain. This kind of blockchain restricts actions to certain participants.If you do not meet all the criteria, then blockchain may not be the best solution to the problem you’re trying to solve.Generally, if you can satisfy your use case with a conventional centralised data architecture, such as a database or other mature technology, this may be a more attractive option and be faster to implement.However, it may be valuable for agencies to test smaller-scale uses of blockchain to determine its effectiveness for their particular use case.Further considerations for potential blockchain deployments Be clear on the governance model of your solution, as centralised governance and control may negate blockchain’s benefits. Tackle data standardisation early. The biggest challenge when implementing a blockchain solution or any other data sharing solution is aligning and normalising multiple, historically independent datasets, but this also provides the most benefit. Be transparent about your motives. Understand the incentives of each party in the network in the short and long terms. It is crucial to understand the role of trust in a blockchain solution.Further readingDo you need a blockchain? by Karl Wust (ETH Zurich) and Arthur Gervais (Imperial College London) is a technical assessment of blockchain technology. It is a good starting point for technical professionals and academics.We have collected some blockchain case studies which may also provide an insight into the possible benefits of a blockchain solution: Blockchain case study: Australian Taxation Office luxury car tax compliance Blockchain case study: Commonwealth Bank and the NDISAGA Code: DES183Type: DesignLinked to: CAP59","exactTitle":"Do you need blockchain?"},{"id":"151","title":"Document Verification Service (DVS)","excerpt":"Details\n","description":"The Document Verification Service (DVS) checks whether the biographic information on person’s identity document matches their original record, helping government organisations to securely and efficiently verify identities and confirm details on documents such as birth certificates, driver licences or Medicare cards.

Transactional platforms – offer direct access to the goods and services needed by agencies and their clients.Understanding the use case requirements, and thus platform focus, allows comparability to previous investment across government and the potential avenues for reuse. Aligning to an archetype can help agencies find a reusable, suitable investment efficiently.Apply human-centred design practices when building e-marketsThe Australian Public Service (APS) is tasked with supporting all Australians throughout their lives. Adopting a human-centred design approach ensures services meet populations’ needs by being as accessible and user friendly as possible.The Digital service standard v2.0 is a set of best-practice principles to help entities design and build digital services that are simple, clear, and fast. Following the Digital service standard ensures digital services provide public value and meet user needs, with ongoing service improvements based on evidence and learnings.Adopt a consistent, effective and efficient approach for identifying businesses and individuals participating in e-marketsE-markets may facilitate the exchange of sensitive data between multiple parties who may have had no previous relationship with each other. As such, it is critical that both parties are authorised, and where possible identity-verified, to reduce the risk of inadvertent access or damage to sensitive data.Businesses are encouraged to create authorisations for employees and other individuals who work on behalf of the business. Businesses are responsible for maintaining the integrity of their records. Using global authentication gateways such as PRODA (Provider digital access) is recommended.Businesses and individuals using e-markets should be verified by an identity system. An identify system is an online environment for identity management transactions governed by a set of system rules (also referred to as a trust framework) where individuals, organisations, services and devices can trust each other because authoritative sources establish and authenticate their identities.Relevant identity exchange/attribute provider accreditation standard models that should be considered in e-markets design include the Australian Government digital ID system (AGDIS).User data is at the core of e-markets. E-market solutions should: protect user privacy by ensuring that practices relating to the collection and use of user data are lawful, transparent, fair, enable user participation and choice, and provide reasonable security safeguards manage digital security risk and implement security measures for reducing or mitigating adverse effects relating to user participation in e-markets.The Australian Signals Directorate produces the Information security manual (ISM). The purpose of the ISM is to outline a cyber security framework that entities can apply to protect their systems, including those related to e-markets, and associated data from cyber threats. Details in the ISM can be accessed here: Information security manual (ISM).Ensure e-markets are used to provide products and services in a manner that prevents unfair conductBusinesses and individuals should adopt fair practices when building and engaging in e-markets by: not engaging in conduct that is unfair or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive not making false or misleading representations about the products or services they supply not engaging in unconscionable conduct (such as collecting data from competitors on price on products or services) ensuring that there is clear demonstration of intent to buy or sell products or offer services ensuring participating businesses are compliant with fair trading laws and operating fairly and competitively. Fair trading laws ensure that businesses inform and protect customers.The participating businesses should consider: Fair trading laws The Australian Consumer Law and your business The Competition and Consumer Act Australian standards Codes of conduct.When selling products or services, businesses need to understand and be compliant with: Australia’s trade measurement laws Displaying prices Product labelling Secure card payments Warranties and refunds.Australian product safety laws apply to e-markets and at every stage of the supply chain. These laws mean that participating businesses: must comply with Australian mandatory safety standards must not supply banned products must report the death or serious injury or illness of a person that occurred as a result of a consumer product supplied by the vendor should immediately recall a product if it may present a safety hazard, does not comply with a safety standard, or is banned – and notify the Australian Commonwealth Minister responsible must comply with any recall notices issued under the Australian Consumer Law should be aware that compliance with international or other trusted safety standards does not automatically mean compliance with Australian safety standards or bans.It is businesses’ responsibility to understand Australian product safety laws and make sure they sell safe, compliant products. These obligations have been summarised by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.See: Selling online | Product Safety Australia.Address data and information privacy and legislative requirementsE-market users should respect privacy by providing clear information about how personal data is handled. Businesses must use and store personal information responsibly, ensuring customer consent, proper security, and anonymisation where appropriate. These practices follow the Australian Privacy Principles, which offer flexible, technology-neutral guidelines for handling personal data.There are key legislative regimes governing digital information assets of Commonwealth entities: The Archives Act 1983 (Cth), aimed at imposing record keeping obligations in respect of Commonwealth records. Digital information assets used in government business are Commonwealth records to be managed in accordance with the Archives Act 1983 (Cth). The Data Availability and Transparency (DAT) Act 2022 (Cth) is intended to improve public sector data accessibility, facilitate its consistent sharing with privacy safeguards, enhance integrity and transparency, instil confidence in its use, and establish institutional sharing arrangements. The Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) is intended to promote and protect the privacy of individuals and to regulate how Australian Government agencies and organisations with an annual turnover of more than $3 million, and some other organisations, handle personal information.There are other key pieces of legislation that may apply depending on the operating context of an entity and information set. Each entity should review relevant federal, state and local requirements to ensure full compliance.For additional information see: Information asset management and Privacy protection.Adhere to reuse principlesNumerous instances of e-market solutions and platforms exist across government, several of which may be suitable for reuse through either shared service models, creating new instances of existing cloud implementations, or leveraging existing patterns. Using existing e-marketplaces is preferred to the development of new platforms.Reuse and reuse potential are also enhanced by greater uniformity in data structures, specifically where data is organised and stored in a consistent manner, and uniformity in integration protocols is developed and maintained.Agencies should look for the existing reusable designs on the AGA website, get in direct contact with entities with comparable use cases, or leverage the existing WofG arrangements and inter-government memorandums of understanding.The Australian Government Architecture provides information for entities on reuse.","exactTitle":"E-markets"},{"id":"159","title":"End user computing","excerpt":"Other government directions\nYou may need to meet specific requirements within these whole-of-government resources.

Beyond these criteria, the hosting, licencing, commissioning, and maintenance (and associated contracts) of any system should be considered.This standard covers ERP at an overarching level. Entities should also consider the following detailed standards: ERP Finance Standard ERP Human Capital Management (HCM) Standard ERP Procurement Standard ERP Travel and Expense Management System (TEMS) StandardAlign to the APS ERP approachUnder the APS ERP approach, all non-corporate Commonwealth entities have autonomy and choice to modernise ERP solutions using technology and vendors that best meet their needs and budgets. When choosing ERP solutions or vendors, entities must align with the principles of: affordability: ERP systems are affordable to acquire, operate and sustain and consider re-use in their development. choice: Entities have autonomy to select contemporary technologies that best meets entity needs. contestability: APS leverages competition in the ERP market to improve service offerings and promote innovation. Smaller entities (defined as having around 800 or less staff) with straightforward, or less complex, ERP requirements must: seek support from the Department of Finance, to understand ERP uplift requirements and choose cost-effective solutions. Entities can seek support by emailing ERPapproach@finance.gov.au.The approach does not prevent entities from seeking or continuing to receive transactional processing services from existing hub providers.Notify the DTA of any ERP investment activitiesGovernance and sequencing of ERP investment is overseen by the Secretaries Data and Digital Committee (SDDC) and Chief Operating Officer (COO) Committee.To facilitate Secretaries’ oversight of the ERP investment pipeline, entities must: identify any ERP uplifts intended over the coming years through the digital investment pipeline data collection so that the pipeline can be presented to SDDC as part of the Integrated Digital Investment Plan (IDIP) identify any planned ERP uplifts through agency Digital Investment Plans (DIPs) to help the DTA gain a complete view of whole-of-government ERP investment planning seek contestability and investment advice from investment@dta.gov.au for development of ERP business cases towards as required for New Policy Proposals (NPPs).Entities should: provide detailed business requirements and specifications to the DTA via investment@dta.gov.au, including technical scope and operating environment obtain guidance, resources, and contribute to the Australian Government Architecture (AGA) by contacting architecture@dta.gov.au seek sourcing advice and guidance from the DTA Digital Sourcing Branch via ICTProcurement@BuyICT.gov.au: access and use of the mandatory ERP category under the Software marketplace ERP project planning, implementation, and transition guidance. Align to the ERP technical standardsEntities should: determine and track low-level requirements in alignment with the technical standards, that break value streams into distinct functional capabilities, and within these nominate key processes that should be enabled by an ERP solution: ERP Finance Standard ERP Human Capital Management (HCM) Standard ERP Procurement Standard ERP Travel and Expense Management System (TEMS) Standard utilise these standards in mapping requirements to reusable designs document their implemented solution against these requirements, so that it can be reused in the future.Determine if an existing solution is suitable before implementing new instancesEntities must: consider suitability of existing instances of ERP solutions and platforms that exist across government, before effort is spent on implementing a bespoke ERP solution.Entities should: reuse existing investment through shared service models or repurposing of existing cloud implementations if frequently affected by Machinery-of-Government (MoG) changes, align technologies with other frequently impacted entities to facilitate the efficient exchange of information and simplify future MoG processes.Identify further ERP reuse opportunitiesWhere existing shared service offerings/cloud solutions are not entirely reusable, entities should: seek to gain value from leveraging existing patterns and other artefacts focus on reusing elements of ERP solutions that benefit from standardisation, including the data formats for payroll data, general ledger, accounts payable and receivable processes, and expense management consume patterns and other artefacts available through the AGA’s design library, existing Whole of Australian Government Arrangements, and inter-government Memorandums of Understanding (MoU).The DTA administers the Australian Government Architecture Repository, a repository of technical artefacts that can be accessed by entities to help identify reuse opportunities. Contact architecture@dta.gov.au to request access.Utilise whole-of-government contracts and panels to acquire ERP products and servicesThe Commonwealth has negotiated terms and conditions through whole-of-government agreements and panel arrangements that consider value for money, legal protections, security and confidentiality provisions, availability and performance requirements, and warranty conditions.Entities must: make use of the ERP Products and Service solutions category on the Software Marketplace when purchasing ERP solutions acquire services related to ERP uplift and integration through the DTA’s Digital Panels or whole-of-government contracts contact ICTProcurement@buyict.gov.au if you have concerns or issues with these arrangements.Customise only as essentialEntities should: ‘adopt rather than adapt’, using ERP technologies as available commercially-off-the- shelf (COTS) if possible assess the business processes documented within the AGA technical standards and housed in the DTA process repository leverage these processes, driving commonality of corporate processes across the Commonwealth and the efficient development of processes and requirements prioritise updating of business processes and policies to align with contemporary technological solutions over the variation (through configuration or customisation) of solutions, to reduce to the extent possible the variation required identify where legislation or legislative instruments outline specific requirements for Commonwealth entities that must be met with variations to commercial solutions or standardised processes consider whole-of-life impacts when committing to any variations, including: ongoing cost of technology specialist resources to meet cyclical updates additional testing to ensure variations continue to work sufficiently added complexities with upstream or downstream integrated systems more involved release scheduling planning use the DATA Scheme managed by the Office of the National Data Commissioner as a basis for enabling the exchange of data between entities, as well as commonality of reporting across the Commonwealth manage process variation in a scalable and sustainable manner, across: Configuration – A way of re-setting the process through modifying data or settings directly within the technology solution. Customisation – Creating or extending the technology solution through altering or adding code, features, or data. Integration – Where varied processes are executed in another system external to the ERP technology solution, with the outcome then returned to and recorded within the ERP solution.Ensure ongoing viability of ERP solutionsEntities must: meet the requirements of the Australian Government Architecture’s eInvoicing policy in any ERP implementation confirm contractual arrangements, MoU currency, and AGA design state prior to investment meet the requirements of the Digital and ICT Reuse Policy.The Australian Government Architecture provides information for entities on Reuse.Entities should: compare their requirements with those of other comparable entities and system functions, and seek to reuse learnings from preceding implementations consider specific functional and non-functional requirements prior to solution design or consideration of technology choice, including: volume and nature of information assets broader system purpose performance and availability requirements privacy/sensitivity concerns when implementing ERP solutions, make ongoing contributions to the Australian Government Architecture Repository collaborate on further developing existing reusable resources to enable the benefits associated with standardisation and reuse as the landscape of ERP implementations evolves.","exactTitle":"Enterprise resource planning (ERP)"},{"id":"168","title":"Enterprise resource planning (ERP) finance","excerpt":"This standard is limited to the Finance sub-capability within Enterprise Resource Planning, and should be viewed within the context of the overarching Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Standard, and alongside standards aligned to the other defined ERP value streams:\n","description":"","url":"/capability/enterprise-resource-planning-finance/standard/","domain":"","type":"AGA Standard","subtype":"","content":"This standard is limited to the Finance sub-capability within Enterprise Resource Planning, and should be viewed within the context of the overarching Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Standard, and alongside standards aligned to the other defined ERP value streams: ERP Human Capital Management (HCM) Standard ERP Procurement Standard ERP Travel and Expense Management System (TEMS) StandardThe ERP Finance capability is essential for the responsible management of public resources, ensuring transparency, and supporting alignment with government objectives.

Functions include processing grant applications, assessment of eligibility, management of grant funding, tracking of grants and grant programs, auditing, and reporting. These functions are common to many government agencies, and many solutions are highly adaptable.Grants are administered by responsible agencies following the Commonwealth Grants Rules and Principles 2024 (CGRPs). CGRPs contain the key legislative policy requirements and explain the better practices and principles of grants administration.Publish on GrantConnectGrantConnect is the centralised location for publishing Australian Government grant opportunities and awards. The system contains information that can be used to search for new grant opportunities, find out who has been awarded grants, and watch for future programs. It is a requirement of the CGRPs that grant opportunities are published on GrantConnect, and that agencies report (on GrantConnect) information on grants no later than twenty-one calendar days after the grant agreement takes effect.Reuse existing designs, patterns and investmentIn addition to GrantConnect, the Commonwealth has established two centralised grants hubs to be operated as shared service arrangements, providing grants administration services to client entities. These hubs increase consistency in the administration and management of grants to support more connected and seamless government services, reduce systems risk in the application of proven designs and achieve financial efficiencies through economies of scale. The two central grant hubs are: Community Grants Hub – administers mainly community-based grants on behalf of Australian Government departments, agencies and organisations. Business Grants Hub – administers mainly business-based grants on behalf of Australian Government departments, agencies, and organisations.Under the shared service arrangements, client agencies are responsible for grant policy and the development of grant programs, while the hubs are responsible for administering grant programs at the direction of policy owners and consistent with the requirements of the CGRPs.Agencies should use the appropriate grant hubs except where there is a specific reason to not do so.For enquiries relating to Commonwealth grants administration arrangements and the relevant estimates memorandum, please contact grantsadmin@finance.gov.au.In addition to the grant hubs, several alternative technology solutions may be considered for future consolidation exist in the Commonwealth landscape. These alternatives may help achieve consistency in existing practices and simplify future consolidation where onboarding to the grant hubs is not mandatory and represent program risks due to timeframes or technical interoperability complexities. Most available solutions are highly configurable and can support numerous variances in: process workflow data collection templatesBuild for reuseWhere reuse has not been determined viable, agencies should provide evidence of which systems have been investigated and demonstrate how any new investment may be extensible and operationalised for reuse.Implementing a grant management system with broad applicability across agencies is critical for reducing risk, increasing efficiency and supporting consistent implementation of grant programs across government.Any new system should be designed with a modular and scalable architecture, allowing for future integration into other agency structures. Emphasising interoperability and standardisation in technologies and data formats ensures adaptability across different agencies. Additionally, user-friendly interfaces and comprehensive documentation facilitates ease of implementation and use streamlining processes and promoting consistency across agencies.Engage the Department of FinanceNon-corporate Commonwealth entities who want to develop their own grant management platform should contact the Department of Finance in the first instance.For all enquiries relating to grant management please visit Commonwealth Grants.","exactTitle":"Grant management"},{"id":"214","title":"Grant management","excerpt":"Explore Grant management resources\n","description":"","url":"/capability/grant-management/resources/","domain":"","type":"Resources list","subtype":"","content":"Explore Grant management resourcesProcess Business Grants Hub Community grants hub System GrantConnect Sapphire","exactTitle":"Grant management"},{"id":"215","title":"Grant management","excerpt":"The grant management policy supports a whole-of-government focus on managing government grants, ensuring consistency, transparency and accountability across entities.

Buyers consider important digital investment factorsWhat does this mean?For information on what each of the digital investment factors means see the Digital Investment Factors Appendix.Why is this important?Considering important digital factors before starting a procurement helps investments meet their intended outcomes. Key investment decisions are often made before procurement requirements are drafted. By the time a procurement commences, it may be too late to retrofit elements of the digital investment factors.Requirements are designed to allow for a range of solutions to deliver business outcomes1. Use outcomes-focused requirementsWhat does this mean?The outcome is the result of the work to be performed (the ‘what’) rather than the way it is to be performed (the ‘how’). This means writing requirements based on the desired outcome and the result of the work to be performed. For example, buyers should not seek to procure defined activities, tasks or assets. Instead of considering inputs (e.g. resources, time and people), buyers should consider outcomes (e.g. an uplift in capability, more efficient processing of records or a service that more users want to use). At a minimum, buyer requirements could ask for outputs (e.g. a strategy or a HR system). Buyers should also use descriptive, not prescriptive language. Being descriptive means using language that describes the problem as part of the requirements, rather than prescribing a pre-conceived solution.Why is this important?Using outcomes-focused requirements reduces the cost of doing business with government. This allows businesses more flexibility when pitching a solution to best solve a problem, rather than trying to meet over-engineered requirements. Focusing on desired outcomes and describing them clearly means sellers have more information. This allows sellers to propose solutions that are more likely to achieve that outcome.2. Create smaller, focused packages of workWhat does this mean?Contracts are designed and broken down into smaller parts of larger projects. Buyer should consider using the Service design and delivery process as a framework for their investment. This process can help create distinct stages of work, such as discovery, alpha and beta, to deliver a better solution.Why is this important?Creating smaller packages of work helps ensure businesses of all sizes can offer solutions to government, increasing competition and opportunities for innovation. By reducing vendor lock-in, shorter contracts allows agencies to bring in new and innovative technology earlier.3. Make access easy for businesses of all sizesWhat does this mean?Clear, high-quality information is provided up front to sellers. This reduces the need to clarify requirements later-on. Classifying work with a higher security classification than is required is avoided. Over-classifying unfairly advantages incumbents who already hold security clearances or sellers that can wait long periods of time for clearances. Remember that having worked with government before cannot be a condition of getting work.Why is this important?Making access easy for business of all sizes helps create a vibrant ecosystem of sellers that can offer more competitive solutions. This increases innovation and helps buyers to discover more options to meet their business needs.Panels that offer a better experience for buyers and sellers are considered (if using a panel)Evaluate Digital Certified panelsWhat does this mean?Buyers are encouraged to evaluate whether a panel on the list of digital certified panels meets their needs, if a panel is their chosen sourcing mechanism. The list helps them to identify modern and fit for purpose panels. Panels are used to buy commonly used, clearly defined products and services. Other methods, like open or limited tender, may be more suitable for other products and services.Why is this important?Digital Certified panels offer opportunities to buy the latest technology from panels that are easier to use for government and have better access for sellers. These panels aim to reduce costs, duplication and burden on buyers and sellers.Evaluations are set up to be fair to all sellers, enabling buyers to find the best opportunities to meet their needs1. The best value for money is not necessarily the tender which offers the lowest priceWhat does this mean?When evaluating proposals from sellers, buyers consider the whole-of-life cost of their investment. Whole-of-life cost includes, but is not limited to, the initial purchase price of a solution, maintenance costs, transition out costs, licensing costs (where applicable), the cost of additional features added after the initial investment, consumable costs and disposal costs.Why is this important?A low initial cost does not necessarily mean a solution will represent Value for Money over its life. Whole-of-life cost is a key component of assessing Value for Money. Costs incurred after the initial purchase could mean a solution with a low initial cost ends up having a high whole-of-life cost.2. Do not unfairly advantage or disadvantage any tenderer. All tenderers should be afforded equal opportunity.What does this mean?Some things to consider to afford all tenderers an equal opportunity are: Encouraging buyers to consider the agency’s risk profile when evaluating proposals and applying it appropriately when designing contracts. For example, buyers may not need to include unlimited liability as a standard requirement for all their contracts. Remember that unlimited liability increases cost and negatively affects all sellers, especially smaller sellers. Not using evaluation criteria that includes a requirement for sellers to have government experience. Remember that having government experience cannot be a condition of getting work.Why is this important?Fairness in government digital sourcing is closely related to the notion of effective competition. An ideal state of fairness would mean equal access to opportunities for all sellers regardless of their size. The Commonwealth Procurement Rules, the Public Governance Performance and Accountability Act 2013 and the Indigenous Procurement Policy include components or measures to achieve fairness.3. Ensure there is no bias or favouritism, declare and manage conflicts of interest.What does this mean?Examples of incorporating these elements when setting up evaluations include: establishing a conflict of interest registry within the agency. providing training to staff to enable them to identify and manage any issues of bias, favouritism or conflicts of interest.Why is this important?Bias, favouritism and conflicts of interest can be unintentionally created in government procurement. For example, an incumbent seller may have the benefit of insights other sellers do not. In this context, it is important to explore ways to improve the imbalance between sellers who already have access and new sellers seeking access to an opportunity.4. Maintain clear and transparent records to inform feedback to sellersWhat does this mean?Maintaining clear and transparent records from the start. Buyers capture the right information from their evaluations to provide feedback to sellers and keep track of their processes and decisions. Buyers use this information to inform their feedback to sellers.Why is this important?Maintaining clear and transparent records will provide valuable evidence when providing feedback in the future to sellers. Providing useful feedback to sellers will help all agencies to maintain a more engaged, informed and competitive pool of sellers.Procurement processes are streamlined to minimise burden and attract sellersSimplify and streamline procurement processesWhat does this mean?Detailed examples of how to simplify and streamline procurement processes are listed under the corresponding ‘How can I implement this standard’ section of the Standards for Digital Sourcing.Why is this important?Streamlining procurement processes will greatly reduce administrative burden on buyers and sellers. It will do this by reducing the time, effort, cost and resources that are expended by all parties in a procurement process. Onerous, complex and lengthy processes also negatively impact competition and value for money across government procurement. Remember that all sellers have difficulty absorbing the cost of procurement and that the smaller the seller, the greater the impact. Buyers also increase their risk of buying old technology if your procurement is protracted.Sellers are provided useful feedback that helps them improveProvide useful feedback on a request for debriefWhat does this mean?Following a request for a debriefing, buyers give feedback to the seller against the broad range of areas and criteria considered in their evaluation process. Buyers consider the relevant financial and non-financial costs and benefits when providing feedback. This includes, but is not limited to, the Value for Money elements outlined in the Commonwealth Procurement Rules. It may be beneficial to have a template that provides feedback against these elements.Why is this important?Providing regular and useful feedback helps sellers improve, creating a more competitive market, driving better value for money and encouraging a diverse range of products and services.AGA Code: DES75Type: DesignLinked to: CAP43","exactTitle":"Guidance for the standards for digital sourcing"},{"id":"220","title":"Guidance on how to use the AI impact assessment tool","excerpt":"Details\n","description":"The Guidance on how to use the AI impact assessment tool supports agencies completing an assessment of their AI use case using the AI impact assessment tool.","url":"/resource/guidance-on-how-to-use-the-ai-impact-assessment-tool/","domain":"","type":"Resource","subtype":"Guidance","content":"DetailsDirect link: www.digital.gov.au/ai/impact-assessment-tool/guidanceResponsible agency: Digital Transformation AgencyLast updated: 1 December 2025About the guidanceThe Guidance on how to use the AI impact assessment tool supports agencies completing an assessment of their AI use case using the AI impact assessment tool.ApplicabilityNon-corporate government Commonwealth entities must conduct an AI use case impact assessment for AI use cases that are in scope of the Policy for the responsible use of AI in government.

Commonwealth entities should explore the best value for money approach when considering the need for HPC resources. Lower cost computing resources may be sufficiently fit-for-purpose to meet organisational needs. Australia’s sovereign capability Certain uses of HPC are critical to Australia’s national interests and sovereign capability, such as: defence capabilities research capabilities biological and health-related capabilities climate and weather modelling certain types of industrial designSome aspects of cybersecurity also require HPC facilities. An emerging aspect of HPC sovereign capability is the development and training of AI Large Language Models (LLM) and other AI models with Australian content, values and cultural contexts. The potential need for Australia to research and build its own, foundational LLM rather than relying on fine-tuning of existing, overseas-controlled models is a current discussion topic in the research community.Over-reliance on foreign HPC capability and capacity is not in Australia’s national interest and Commonwealth entities need to consider the whole-of-government perspective and the opportunities to partner with Australia’s research community to meet their HPC needs.Improved, secure access and sharing of HPC resources for both researchers and government is becoming an imperative. This will include access to Quantum computing facilities as these become available.There is a general distinction between HPC resources required for the research &amp; development of models, including AI LLM training, and the deployment of those models for inference uses in operational settings, which does not necessarily require HPC facilities or sovereign capacity. Australia’s research competitiveness Research is becoming increasingly reliant on computational capacity, and there is a growing correlation between researchers’ access to HPC resources and the global competitiveness of that research. For Australia’s research competitiveness going forward, Commonwealth entities should consider the positive effects of supporting Australian HPC research facilities through utilisation of those facilities where appropriate. Australia’s trade interests To support Australian industry and ensure Australia’s continuing participation in global supply chain and value chain activities associated with HPC, Commonwealth entities should support Australian owned and operated HPC facilities wherever possible.

The Government continues to maintain the safe, secure operation of the systems and technology through: the effective implementation of the Information security manual, the Protective security policy framework (PSPF) and the Essential eight mitigation strategies increasingly adopting secure-by-design and secure-by-default principles and tactics investing in secure data centres and associated infrastructure that provide hosting services for Commonwealth entities.The Information Asset Security standard has been developed to support these aims. It ensures that applications are developed and maintained with security in mind, protecting sensitive information assets and preventing unauthorised access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of those assets. It is critical this standard be considered alongside those of complementary capabilities: Application Security Network Security Permissions.Align to guidelines and standardsEntities must: apply the principles and requirements of the Protective security policy framework (PSPF) throughout their organisation meet the requirements of the Hosting certification framework (HCF).Entities should consider and align, where suitable, to security frameworks across Government, including: Information security manual Strategies to mitigate cyber security incidents.Entities should also consider the following from organisations outside of the APS: ISO/IEC 27001 defines requirements an information security management system ISMS must meet. The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) provides comprehensive resources in relation to data security, including the OWASP data security top 10 which outlines the key security risks for storing and moving sensitive and personally identifiable information, the challenges involved and how to overcome them.Be secure-by-designEntities should: take a secure-by-design approach to information asset security as defined and recommended by the Australian Signals Directorate implement Essential Eight Maturity Level 2 mitigations as a minimum implement ISM controls within the defined areas of: application control patch applications configure Microsoft Office macro settings user application hardening restrict administrative privileges patch operating systems multi-factor authentication regular backups.Align operational and technological needsEntities should: design information asset security measures and solutions to integrate seamlessly with an entity’s existing security infrastructure to provide layered security understand the specific type of information being handled and tailor security measures accordingly use trusted suppliers, vetted as part of cyber supply chain risk management assessments record suppliers on their approved supplier list once vetted adopt advanced encryption methods, secure communication protocols and intrusion detection systems to safeguard both data in transit and data at rest ensure security solutions for information assets are scalable and flexible to adapt to evolving threats and technological advancements integrate security awareness and training programs, as human factors may pose a significant risk to the security of information assets.Apply a risk-based approachEntities should: be careful to ensure that security mechanisms do not inadvertently impact the performance, availability, accessibility or other aspects of systems to the detriment of the user experience be careful to ensure that security and authentication mechanisms do not inadvertently make digital records inaccessible in the long term prioritise security considerations throughout all stages of the software delivery lifecycle, including when architecting, developing, testing and deploying applications integrate security awareness and training programs demonstrate and foster a culture of security among their employees.Select and implement appropriate information asset security controlsThe Australian Government uses four security classifications: OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED SECRET TOP SECRETAll other information from business operations and services is OFFICIAL by default. UNOFFICIAL information is information that does not form part of official duty.Entities must: apply the Australian Government recordkeeping metadata standard ensure security classified information is stored, transferred and disposed of appropriately.Entities should: consider declassifying or downgrading records when protection is no longer needed understand the specific type of information asset being held or transferred, and tailor security measures accordingly.Implement detective measuresEntities should: implement detective controls such as intrusion detection systems and agents that monitor data health and availability develop and implement mechanisms for continuous vulnerability assessment and remediation across all stages of the application development lifecycle monitor emerging risks and understand the threats these pose to their specific information assets.Implement reporting measuresEntities should: consider and implement appropriate reporting processes have protocols and processes for reporting and recording any security incidents.Implement corrective measuresEntities should: establish a process for timely identification of attacks to prevent further compromise of the application be able to understand the impact of an attack, by gathering facts and evaluating risks, including potential harm to affected individuals, and, where possible, take action to remediate any risk of harm ensure secure data redundancy such that critical systems can be restored and made available following any breach.Adhere to reuse principlesFor further information on reuse, see the AGA’s Reuse standard.Entities should: consider application security-specific functional and non-functional requirements prior to solution design or consideration of technology choice, including: volume and nature of information assets broader system purpose performance and availability requirements privacy/sensitivity concerns meet the requirements of the whole-of-government reuse policy.Comply with legislation and regulationEntities must: comply with relevant whole-of-government laws, regulations and domain standards including (but not limited to): Archives Act 1983 (Cth) Data Availability and Transparency (DAT) Act 2002 (Cth) Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) Security of Critical Infrastructure Act 2018 (Cth) comply with any other legislation applicable to specific functions and circumstances, such as Strategies to mitigate cyber security incidents.","exactTitle":"Information Asset Security"},{"id":"243","title":"Information asset management","excerpt":"Information is one of the most valuable assets the Australian Government holds and should be managed in a similar way to other high value assets.\n","description":"","url":"/capability/information-asset-management/standard/","domain":"","type":"AGA Standard","subtype":"","content":"Information is one of the most valuable assets the Australian Government holds and should be managed in a similar way to other high value assets.Entities should adopt a strategic approach to managing information related to their data and digital investments. If the information assets are proactively managed across the whole investment lifecycle, this will help organisations to more effectively achieve their organisational objectives.Information asset management solutions should ensure information assets remain genuine, accurate, complete, findable, useable and secure from unauthorised access, alteration and deletion while adhering to relevant legislation. Principles for well-managed information assets can be found in the National Archives of Australia’s (NAA’s) Information management standard for the Australian Government.Entities should also adhere to ethical principles, with transparency, accountability and consent at the forefront of data collection. Individuals or the community should be informed about what data is being collected and for what purpose, and how it will be used. Additionally, entities may be required to gain explicit consent from individuals before collecting sensitive data.Applicability of this standardThese statements detail how entities can meet this standard and comply with the Information asset management policy.Share and collaborateAlign to data ontologiesWhere possible, entities should align to the WofG data.gov.au dataset ontology. This ontology is designed to describe the characteristics of datasets published on data.gov.au. Entities may also consider other portfolio or sector-specific data ontologies. This promotes data accuracy, reduces redundancy and streamlines decision making processes.Classification creates a standardised approach or ‘common language’ for naming, organising, retrieving and sharing content. This helps linking content to a business context and informs decisions regarding disposal, retention, access and security. This uniformity enhances accuracy and ease of retrieval and ensures consistency, supporting freedom of information and change management processes across agencies.Tools like business classification schemes, records classification tools, classification by function, functions thesaurus, and records authorities help develop an agency’s classificationAlign to metadata standardsTo meet requirements of the Office of the National Data Commissioner (ONDC) to enable data sharing and the NAA’s requirements for effective management of information assets over time, entities should refer to the: Australian Government recordkeeping metadata standard – designed to help entities meet business, accountability and archival requirements in a systematic and consistent way by maintaining reliable, meaningful and accessible records ONDC metadata attributes guide – developed to aid entities that are considering data inventory uplift work.Alignment with common WofG metadata standards is a crucial part of effective information asset management. Alignment facilitates interoperability and enhances information asset integration and sharing across entities. Comprehensive metadata must accompany public datasets, retaining information on data sources, methodologies and any limitations to facilitate accurate interpretation and application.Create inventories and cataloguesThe NAA recommends entities design and maintain an information asset register to enable entity-wide understanding of records, information and data.The Australian Government data catalogue is hosted on Dataplace and it is a searchable online index developed by the ONDC to help users discover, request and access data held by Australian Government agencies. The catalogue draws on open and restricted data to facilitate the use of public sector data for innovation, research and improved government services. The catalogue contains metadata but does not host the actual data, rather it directs users to the relevant data custodians for access.Implement appropriate information asset governance and risk frameworksInformation asset governance is a system for managing information assets across an entity. Entities should develop an ongoing information asset governance system, as well as appoint a chief information governance officer. The Foundational Four provides entities with guidance on establishing an ongoing data governance program.Share as open by defaultThe Australian Government’s public data policy resources require all Commonwealth entities to make non-sensitive data open by default. At a minimum, entities will publish appropriately anonymised government data by default: on or linked through data.gov.au for discoverability and availability in a machine-readable, spatially enabled format with high quality, easy to use and freely available API access (API content on the Australian Government Architecture provides information on how data should be shared securely) with descriptive metadata which adhere to the metadata standards using agreed open standards kept up to date in an automated way under a Creative Commons by attribution licence unless a clear case is made to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet for another open licence.Share with states and territoriesIn addition to the open by default requirements, the Intergovernmental Agreement on data sharing between Commonwealth and State and Territory governments (IGA) requires that public sector data be shared as a default position between states, territories and the Commonwealth where it can be done securely, safely, lawfully and ethically. Data shared under the IGA must be in accordance with established privacy and security standards and policies, including complaints handling processes.Share on DataplaceDataplace is a WofG platform maintained by the ONDC on which to request Australian Government data, including under the DATA Scheme. The platform brings together those wanting to get access to Australian Government data (such as researchers and those working on public policy and delivering public services) with Commonwealth entities who are the data custodians.Collaborate with the private and research sectorsEntities should explore opportunities to facilitate public-private partnerships and public research partnerships to jointly address challenges and opportunities, leveraging the expertise of both external sectors to derive innovative solutions that benefit the public. The private sector and researchers could be encouraged to develop applications, tools or insights that use public data, which fosters innovation.Entities should also explore opportunities to provide training programs and capacity building initiatives to enhance the skills of private and research sector professionals working with public data, fostering a more robust ecosystem.Collaborate with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peopleEntities should partner with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people at all stages of the data lifecycle to ensure their priorities are reflected in data about their communities. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leadership is crucial for improving the relevance, accessibility, interpretability and timeliness of Indigenous data in the APS.The Framework for the Governance of Indigenous Data aims to improve the accessibility, relevance, interpretability and timeliness of government held data for Aboriginal Torres Strait Islander people. Non-corporate Commonwealth entities are required to prepare implementation plans responding to the actions contained within the framework together with a timeframe for implementation.Appropriately create, manage, retain and dispose information assetsEach entity will have business systems that create, keep and manage information assets, including data and datasets. Data and datasets retained in business systems, like other information created and received in connection with Australian government business, are Commonwealth records and must be managed in accordance with the Archives Act 1983.The NAA’s current WofG policy Building Trust in the Public Record: Managing information and data for government and community outlines implementation actions to achieve the policy outcomes of strategic information asset governance, fit for purpose information management processes, practices and systems, and the reduction of information management inefficiency and risk.Retain and disposeEntities must manage information assets in accordance with their minimum retention period. These periods are usually set by the NAA though legal instruments known as records authorities. Disposal may involve arranging secure destruction of the information assets (including data and datasets) or, where applicable, transferring custody or ownership of the information assets to another entity through machinery of government changes. More information can be found here Retaining, managing and disposing of data and datasets.Transparent, responsible and secure handling of information assets is essential. The NAA provides further guidance to entities on outsourcing digital storage options, including data centre, digital repository and cloud computing. A key policy to protecting Australian Government systems and the data they hold is the Hosting Certification Framework. It operationalises the principles outlined in the Whole-of-Government Hosting Strategy, in particular the requirement that all data must be hosted with the appropriate level of privacy, sovereignty and security controls.Datasets of enduring value should be labelled ‘Retain as National Archives’ (RNA) in relevant records authorities. These are typically of permanent value, meaning they have historical, cultural or evidential importance and must be preserved. These should be transferred into the care of the NAA. In some instances, particularly for large datasets with continuing business use, the NAA may enter an agreed distributed custody arrangement, where an entity will continue to manage the dataset that has been identified as part of the archival resources of the Australian Government.Specify and maintain stringent information asset control conditionsMost Commonwealth entities are subject to mandatory requirements detailed in the Australian Government Protective Security Policy Framework.There are three core protective security policies that together safeguard government information assets from unauthorised access or harm: Personnel security – ensuring that access to information is provided on a strict need to know basis only to people who have been assessed as suitable. Physical security – preventing unauthorised access or harm to government resources, including information assets, through physical control measures such as entry barriers and security systems. Information and communication technology security – having in place operational procedures and technical control measures to manage access, transmission, storage and disposal of information.Plan for digital preservationEnsure that consideration is given to retention periods that may be longer than the life of the system that data are captured in. Preserving information assets may require migration to new platforms and formats. Regular and planned migration helps avoid obsolescence and ensures information continues to be accessible and usable. The NAA provides further information about digital preservation planning.Align operational and technological needsWhen adopting an information asset management solution, entities should ensure alignment with operational needs. It is important that the solution has sufficient functionality to manage information assets appropriately.The NAA’s Business System Assessment Framework provides Commonwealth entities with a consistent, streamlined, risk-based approach to the assessment of information management functionality in business systems and compliance with metadata standards. It is consistent with Part 1 of International Standard ISO16175, which provides internationally agreed functional requirements and associated guidance for applications that manage digital records.Information asset management requirements should be considered for office productivity software such as Microsoft 365 as well as for current, emerging and critical technologies.Ensure that data is easy to exchange and share for business efficiency and accountabilityData interoperability enables the exchanging of data between different systems and organisations. The Data Interoperability Maturity Model (DIMM) provides a way to assess an entity’s progress towards data interoperability.The decision between certain technological solutions (e.g. a SQL database, data lake, data warehouse, etc.) may be significant, especially when handling larger pools of complex data. When choosing how to house their data, entities should consider: the format of the data (structured, unstructured or semi-structured) the value and purpose of the data data processing requirements data storage and budget constraints who is using the data technology and data ecosystems.More information on data interoperability can be found in the Integration domain.Engage earlyEntities must ensure early engagement with the DTA where proposals for information asset management systems either: identify that system development will be part of future budget rounds indicate the intention to undertake an investigation which may require an asset management system in the future.These should be sourced from a collaboration between information, records and data teams and ICT areas. The NAA, through its Agency Service Centre, may also be of assistance.Adhere to reuse principlesEntities must adhere to the reuse principles.Before an entity procures a system or reviews existing systems, it should consider its use-case-specific information asset requirements, including volume and nature of data, information and records, broader system purpose, performance matters, and privacy/sensitivity concerns.Depending on needs, entities should consider platforms that implement mechanisms for both real-time and batch data integration, allowing the platform to accommodate different data collection frequencies based on the nature of the information. The entity should enforce stringent data quality checks during the collection process to identify and rectify inaccuracies or inconsistencies at the source. Finally, standardised data formats and protocols should be used to facilitate seamless integration and ensure uniformity in the collected data.The Australian Government Architecture provides information for entities on reuse.Comply with legislationEntities must comply with the following regulations: The Archives Act 1983 (Cth), enables the NAA to determine record-keeping standards and provide related advice to Commonwealth entities, and imposes record keeping obligations in respect of Commonwealth records. Digital information assets used in government business are Commonwealth records to be managed in accordance with the Archives Act 1983 (Cth). The Data Availability and Transparency (DAT) Act 2022 (Cth) is intended to improve public sector data accessibility, facilitate its consistent sharing with privacy safeguards, enhance integrity and transparency, instil confidence in its use, and establish institutional sharing arrangements. The Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Cth) gives the Australian public the right to access documents held by Australian Government agencies and ministers, unless an exemption applies, as well as rights pertaining to documents under the FOI Act that contain information about an individual or their business. The Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) is intended to promote and protect the privacy of individuals and to regulate how Australian Government agencies and organisations with an annual turnover of more than $3 million, and some other organisations, handle personal information.There are other key pieces of legislation that may also apply depending on the operating context of an entity and information set. Each entity should review relevant federal, state, and local requirements to ensure full compliance.","exactTitle":"Information asset management"},{"id":"244","title":"Information asset management","excerpt":"The information asset management policy provides whole-of-government guidance for the classification, storage, access and disposal of government information assets.

It is provided for government agencies to implement within their organisation. APS staff should follow their agency’s policies and guidance on using generative AI tools in the first instance.Feedback from public consultation on the responsible use of AI in Australia will be used to inform consideration across government on appropriate regulatory and policy responses that may include future iterations of this guidance.Click here to see the current guidance. For previous versions of this guidance, see the change log table below.Introduction for agenciesGenerative AI presents new and innovative opportunities for government and an increasing number of tools and models are now easily available to use.However, due to their rapid evolution and uptake, there is an urgent need and growing demand for guidance to support the consideration and assessment of the risks involved in their use.Whole-of-government and agency-specific policies provide guidance on ensuring the appropriate, safe and effective use of technology tools, including AI. However, given the ease of access and use with publicly available generative AI tools like ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot and Google Bard, this interim guidance is recommended for government agencies to use as the basis for providing advice to their staff. It is also recommended as the basis for advice in relation to the enterprise version of Microsoft Copilot (previously referred to as Bing Chat Enterprise), where agencies have enabled it for staff use.In addition to the interim guidance for staff, we recommend agencies: consider implementing an enrolment mechanism to register and approve staff user accounts to access public generative AI platforms. This could include appropriate approval processes through relevant senior accountable officers (e.g. Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) or Chief Information Officer (CIO)). implement an internal feedback/reporting mechanism to evaluate any challenges staff are facing in following guidance. seek to move to commercial arrangements for generative AI solutions as soon as it is possible.In exploring commercial arrangements for generative AI solutions, agencies should consider whether service providers and their AI services have undergone a security assessment by an Infosec Registered Assessor Program (IRAP) assessor to determine their security posture and security risks associated with their use. This assurance may better enable agencies to leverage the benefits of generative AI solutions while meeting their data security and privacy requirements. Otherwise, agencies should apply the guidance under ‘privacy protection and security’ as the default advice for the level of classification/sensitivity of information that may be entered into generative AI solutions.Agencies may also consider developing or using in-house AI models that do not rely on sending data to an external AI service provider.While the default position of this guidance continues to be a recommendation that staff use work email addresses instead of personal email addresses where it is necessary to log in to public generative AI tools, it is up to each agency to consider how it appropriately applies the guidance. Using work email addresses provides staff with a clearer separation between work and personal use of these tools. A range of obligations apply to actions undertaken by Australian Public Service (APS) staff in connection with their employment, including those outlined under the APS Values, Employment Principles and Code of Conduct.As the Government’s understanding of the legislative, administrative and broader risks of this technology evolves, the DTA, in collaboration with DISR, will investigate the development of whole-of-government policies and frameworks relating to the responsible use of AI in government.In the meantime, we encourage agencies to build on this interim guidance and implement agency-level policies. The interim guidance will be updated as needed to provide the latest advice on how to approach generative AI.We also invite agencies to provide feedback on the value, applicability or relevance of this guidance by emailing digitalpolicy@dta.gov.au. Version Date Status Notes 2.0 22/11/2023 Current This update: * updates the introduction for agencies section with additional discussion on commercial and in-house generative AI tools and clarifies the reporting recommendation as relating to an internal agency feedback/reporting mechanism * restructures the guidance to align more closely with Australia’s AI Ethics Principles including the addition of new sections on human, societal and environmental wellbeing &amp; fairness and human-centred values * removes Figure 1 (initial high-risk assessment) due to feedback about clarity and consistency * includes additional guidance under the accountability principle, including on the responsible use of AI-generated coding outputs (previously identified as high risk) * adds a new point to the tactical guidance on ongoing monitoring of tools or processes incorporating generative AI * adds a new use case example on using generative AI tools for basic data analysis on publicly-available data. 1.0 21/07/2023 Superseded   AGA Code: DES116Type: Design","exactTitle":"Interim guidance on government use of public generative AI tools"},{"id":"254","title":"International Communications Network (ICN) Stabilisation ","excerpt":"Details\n","description":"Program of work to stabilise the International Communications Network (ICN), and undertake a scoping study to determine the long-term secure communications technology, systems and data capability required to support Australia&#39;s global secure communications requirements.","url":"/resource/international-communications-network-stabilisation/","domain":"","type":"Resource","subtype":"","content":"DetailsProgram of work to stabilise the International Communications Network (ICN), and undertake a scoping study to determine the long-term secure communications technology, systems and data capability required to support Australia’s global secure communications requirements.AGA Code: DES48Type: Design","exactTitle":"International Communications Network (ICN) Stabilisation "},{"id":"255","title":"Internet of Things","excerpt":"View more resources\n","description":"The network of physical objects that are able to connect to the Internet.","url":"/capability/internet-of-things/","domain":"Technology reference","type":"Capability","subtype":"","content":"View more resourcesConnect with peersConnect with practitioners and experts across the Australian Public Service to share experience and ask questions.

Whilst Mainframe computers deliver several distinct advantages for certain types of computing workload, the particular risks associated with mainframe usage warrant a set of proactive standards to be adopted, which will enable the Australian Government to manage these risks appropriately and ensure the best performance, resilience and currency for the particular applications needed by Commonwealth entities and the best strategic advantage for the nation on digital investments.These standards also recognise that mainframe computers may play an important role in emerging technology fields such as AI and quantum computing.Utilise the appropriate whole-of-government procurement contractEntities must: liaise with the DTA contract team to identify the appropriate whole-of-government contract arrangements in place ensure all procurement of mainframe infrastructure and services are purchased under whole-of-government procurement contract arrangements.Host mainframe infrastructure in complying computing facilitiesEntities must: apply the principles and requirements of the Protective Security Policy Framework throughout their organisation apply a risk-based approach to cyber security for Mainframe computing facilities, to align with the Information Security Manual (ISM).Identify and assess mainframe applications in useEntities should: implement a coherent Enterprise Architecture practice which clearly identifies information systems (applications) and data which rely on mainframe technology components detail how applications reliant on mainframe computing facilities support their organisational needs regularly assess whether the application meets organisational needs, including current and foreseeable changes regularly assess whether the solution architecture of an application represents the most appropriate environment available, enabling the performance and agility to meet anticipated changes in organisational needs assess the Total Cost of Operating (TCO) for applications, from a business/operational perspective and a technical perspective, including staff costs, software licensing, hardware, hosting, advisory/specialist support, and other associated costs explore the best value for money options when considering plans for existing mainframe applications. Lower cost computing resources may be sufficiently fit-for-purpose to meet organisational needs, whilst enabling greater functionality and agility to meet organisational needs ensure that all mainframe applications are incorporated into a mainframe modernisation strategy, incorporating risk assessments which combine the workforce skills risk, application modernisation risk, and risks associated with not investing in application modernisation consider the overall application portfolio risk whilst assessing the best course of action for each application consider options for modernisation of applications, including the following ‘five R’s’ (courtesy of Gartner):RehostRedeploy the application to other infrastructure (physical, virtual or cloud) without recompiling, modifying the application code, or modifying its features and functions.ReplatformMigrate the application to a new runtime platform. This may include minimal changes to code for compatibility with the new platform (e.g. To use cloud services or another database platforms), but no changes to the code structure.RearchitectRestructure and optimise existing code without changing its behaviour to remove technical debt and improve nonfunctional attributes and structure. This can include a shift to a new application architecture or platform to exploit new and better capabilities. This can also include code transformation or refactoring.RebuildRebuild or rewrite the application. This includes the possibility to create a like-for-like replacement of the application and preserve its scope and specifications.ReplaceEliminate the former application and replace it with an available vendor solution, taking new requirements and needs into account.Manage mainframe workforce skills riskEntities should: manage the mainframe workforce skills risk by assessing this risk and proactively collaborating across the APS to mitigate the risk undertake, for each application, a skills assessment which includes details of the specialist skills needed to operate the application effectively to meet operational needs, including planned and anticipated changes regularly undertake an overall application portfolio skills requirement assessment, which includes any shared technology components used by multiple applications weight skills-requirement assessments against a regularly updated stock-take of the specialist skills capacity available inhouse from organisational staff, from the wider pool of APS staff resources, and from all other sources, considering the relative costs and responsiveness of these resources seek to establish resource pooling arrangements between themselves and other relevant entities and take a proactive role in working groups informing the APS Commission’s Digital Workforce Strategy to ensure mainframe skills are appropriately included in planning activities.Ensure an effective hybrid technology environmentCommonwealth entities which operate mainframe environments must: ensure that mainframe-based applications and data are effectively integrated into a hybrid technology environment replicate mainframe-hosted data to other secure commodity computing environments, enabling downstream uses of data such as reporting and access via user portals.Entities should: transition front-end technologies, which provide end user interface experiences and input data into mainframe applications, to commodity computing environments document back-end real-time processing and batch processing jobs based on mainframe components, and transition these to modern cost-effective and risk-balanced solutions aligned to the mainframe modernisation strategy.Transition away from outdated technologiesWhen considering a balanced approach to application portfolio modernisation according to their strategic and operational needs, Commonwealth entities must: develop strategy to transition away from outdated and/or unsupported code bases, transaction processing environments, and database environments to mitigate the workforce skills risk, agility risk and value for money risk prioritise digital investments which enable this transition in the overall ICT Strategy.This will reduce overall risk for the Australian Government and enable greater agility to respond to changing government policy needs.Adhere to reuse principlesThe Australian Government Architecture provides information for entities on Reuse.Entities should: compare their requirements with those of other comparable entities and system functions, and seek to reuse learnings from preceding migrations consider specific functional and non-functional requirements prior to transition of any application(s) away from mainframe platforms, including: volume and nature of data and computational requirements broader entity purpose performance and availability requirements privacy/sensitivity concerns meet the requirements of the Digital and ICT Reuse Policy.","exactTitle":"Mainframe"},{"id":"263","title":"Mainframe","excerpt":"This policy describes the requirements for entities planning digital investments involving mainframe computing facilities.

Session Network coordination between two separate applications in a single session, including opening and closing communication between devices. Transport End-to-end communication between devices, including assurance that transported data packets arrive in the right order, without losses or errors, often demanding flow control and error correction. Network Routing, forwarding, and addressing across multiple connected networks of nodes or machines.

Security Service Edge (SSE): A subset of SASE that secures access to the web, cloud services, and private applications. Generative Cybersecurity AI: Generates derived versions of security-related and other relevant content, strategies, designs, and methods by learning from large repositories of original source data. Identity-First Security: Makes identity-based controls the foundational element of an organisation’s protection architecture. Zero-Trust Architecture (ZTA): A network security paradigm that mandates a proxy that decides whether to grant each access request based on a risk profile calculated from combined contextual factors such as the application, location, user, device, time of day, and data sensitivity. Quantum Cryptography: Utilisation of quantum computing to allow communication via more secure methods than those guaranteed by traditional cryptography. where there is potential for emergent technologies to impact on the network security of the entity, determine an approach and incorporate this into this into their network recovery and remediation strategy and vulnerability assessments.Adhere to reuse principlesThe Australian Government Architecture provides information for entities on Reuse.Entities should: compare their requirements with those of other comparable entities and system functions, and seek to reuse learnings from preceding implementations consider specific functional and non-functional requirements prior to solution design or consideration of technology choice, including: auditability requirements of use cases, processes and/or outcomes privacy requirements of individuals, organisations, processes, or intellectual property security needs, particularly if the system contains sensitive or personally identifying data or is otherwise likely a target for threat actors availability/redundancy, especially in the case of systems supporting round-the-clock needs such as medical or emergency service activities meet the requirements of the Digital and ICT Reuse Policy.","exactTitle":"Network Security"},{"id":"292","title":"Network Security","excerpt":"This policy describes the requirements for entities planning digital investments requiring network security consideration.

Specific use cases can be broadly categorised into the following archetypes: Stakeholder and service provider payments: Disbursement of financial benefits or entitlements directly to individuals, businesses, organisations, or authorised representatives. Rebate payments to service providers: Payments made to service providers who offer government approved or subsidised services to eligible individuals, businesses, organisations or authorised representatives. Vendor payments: Payments made to vendors and suppliers providing goods and services to government entities. This archetype is typically included within an ERP solutions – see ERP finance standard. Refunds: Issuance of refunds to individuals or businesses who have overpaid monies to an entity. Commercial fee payments: Collection of payments related to duties, fees, or similar. Public donations and contributions: Collection of donations or voluntary contributions from individuals or businesses to fund specific government initiatives or causes. Fund collection/distribution systems: An entity collects funds from one party and redistributes them to another, acting as an intermediary. Fund collections: An entity collects funds from an individual, business or other organisation in accordance with legislation.Prioritise standardisation and interoperabilityEntities should: ensure that payment systems can integrate to an external financial institutes and other third-party payment processors regularly test interoperability to ensure that updates or changes in one system do not disrupt payment processes.Ensure security and fraud preventionEntities should: use secure networks and data carriers encrypt data both in transit and at rest implement role-based access controls within the payments systems, and any upstream systems, ensuring that only authorised personnel have access to sensitive payment information (refer to Permissions for further detail) implement continuous monitoring systems to detect and prevent fraudulent activity pre-payment and in real time implement and maintain robust verification procedures to ensure accurate collection, storage and validation of bank account details before processing any payments, ensuring funds are directed to the correct recipient.Set payment timelines and prompt payment standardsEntities should: set clear timelines for processing payments to both promote prompt payment by individuals and businesses, and give recipients confidence in their timely receipt of funds if relevant, ensure the ability to expediate and prioritise emergency payments, enabling rapid response in critical situations such as natural disasters.Ensure, and report on, transparency and reportingEntities should: utilise real-time reporting and monitoring capabilities to provide transparent and up-to-date information on payment processes, including status tracking for all stakeholders leverage the payment platforms centralised data architecture to ensure consistency and accuracy in financial reporting across all entities set defined metrics for transparency, and regularly review and report against these.Engage stakeholders and consider user experienceEntities should: enable users to manage their payment options in a simple and accessible manner in line with guidance on Digital Portals consider automating dispute resolution workflows to ensure timely resolution of payment disputes.Prioritise simplicity, sustainability, scalability, and emerging trendsEntities must: prepare to transition away from the Bulk Electronic Clearing System framework, expected to close in 2030, in line with the Strategic Plan for Australia’s Payments System.Entities should: consider the integration of the New Payment Platform into existing payment systems to enable real-time processing maintain interoperability with other payment systems and platforms to ensure seamless integration with emerging technologies formulate a strategic roadmap for reducing cheque usage, prioritizing a phased migration to digital payment methods focus on electronic payments to reduce paper use, aligning payment methods with environmental sustainability goals ensure that any payment-related investment is scalable, accommodating future growth and technological innovations whilst enabling advanced analytics to support shift processes and users to digital payments while ensuring minimal disruption, tailoring the approach to meet the needs of different user groups offer a range of digital payment options, allowing users to choose methods that are convenient and accessible to them regularly elevate and update their payment platforms to integrate new technologies ensure payment systems incorporate or enable integration of advanced analytics to support ongoing operational needs.Adhere to reuse principlesThe Australian Government Architecture provides information for entities on reuse.Entities should: compare their requirements with those of other comparable entities and system functions, and seek to reuse learnings from preceding implementations consider specific functional and non-functional requirements prior to solution design or consideration of technology choice, including: volume and nature of payment activities broader entity purpose performance and availability requirements privacy/sensitivity concerns meet the requirements of the whole-of-government reuse policy.","exactTitle":"Payments"},{"id":"309","title":"Payments","excerpt":"Other government directions\nYou may need to meet specific requirements within these whole-of-government resources.

Unique business needs and governance requirements will dictate solution selection, design and implementation.The considerations outlined in this standard are intended to ensure suitable and effective permission implementations across government, assisting entities with reuse of existing investment and developing repeatable patterns.Confirm permissions applicabilityEntities should use the following recommended criteria to confirm the applicability and classification of a permissions solution: Does the permission allow the assessed entity to be something, do something or have something? Is an eligibility assessment conducted, and does a specific set of eligibility conditions have to be met? Has the outcome of the eligibility assessment been captured, and the assessed entity advised of the outcome?Examples of outcomes that meet the above criteria include: sharing data or consenting to usage authorising someone to act on behalf of another person or entity (e.g. power of attorney, nominee) providing a permit to a resident to do something (e.g. at their property or business).Other applicable examples will depend on the business function of each entity. Note that some permissions may lead to an entitlement being provided. The scope and granting of entitlements are covered in the Entitlements capability in the Australian Government Architecture.Comply with legislationEntities must: comply with relevant whole-of-government laws, regulations and domain standards including: Archives Act 1983 (Cth) Data Availability and Transparency (DAT) Act 2002 (Cth) Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Cth) Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) comply with any other legislation applicable to specific functions and circumstances.Identify permissions-related rolesEntities should: define a model for permissions that suits their needs align (and maintain) a mapping of roles in their context to this model use this model to shape decisions on solution design and ongoing use.The W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model v1.1 (w3.org) introduces several key roles, and can be useful when considering an entity’s permissions structure. Each role is defined by its specific steps and functions in the end-to-end permissions process. The following roles are introduced in the specification: Holder – A role an entity might perform by possessing one or more verifiable credentials and generating verifiable presentations from them. Examples include students, employees and customers. Issuer – An entity that makes claims about one or more subjects, creates a verifiable credential from these claims and transmits the verifiable credential to a holder. Examples include corporations, non-profit organisations, trade associations, governments and individuals. Subject – An entity about which claims are made. Examples include human beings, animals and things. In many cases the holder of a verifiable credential is the subject, but not in all. For example, a parent (the holder) might hold the verifiable credentials of a child (the subject), or a pet owner (the holder) might hold the verifiable credentials of their pet (the subject). Verifier – The entity receiving one or more verifiable credentials, optionally inside a verifiable presentation, for processing. Examples include employers, security personnel and websites. Verifiable data registry – A system that mediates the creation and verification of identifiers, keys and other relevant data, such as verifiable credential schemas, revocation registries, issuer public keys and so on, which might be required to use verifiable credentials. Some configurations might require correlating identifiers for subjects. Examples include trusted databases, decentralised databases, government ID databases and distributed ledgers. Often there is more than one type of verifiable data registry utilised in a permissions ecosystem.Identify permissions decision typePermissions solutions can be used within entities to assist decision-making. Typically, entity decision-making may be broadly classified into: Immediate decisions based on the provision of evidence or specific guardrails being met. These permissions generally allow the applicant to proceed with their application as a right, whether it is framed as an ad hoc permission or part of their ongoing eligibility. Future decisions based on assumptions about future need. These decisions are predictive, and subject to future review and confirmation. For example, ‘life events’, where an entity predicts that an individual may need a service or services in the future.Entities should: recognise and identify against decision types during the design stage of permissions solution development identify business and technology systems to suit decision types within the entity’s operational requirements.Align operational and technological needsWhile a range of functional requirements can be captured and considered, end user permission systems typically align to a supplier-specific solution. Options will vary, however there are a range of vendor-agnostic system functions that should be considered and incorporated if appropriate, e.g. zero-trust architecture.Entities must: ensure permissions solutions appropriately log and attribute all permissions decisions, including the denying, granting and revoking of permissions in line with auditability requirements meet privacy requirements of individuals, organisations, processes and intellectual property meet security needs, particularly if the system contains sensitive or personally identifying data or is otherwise likely a target for threat actors.Entities should: design permission solutions to integrate seamlessly with an entity’s existing infrastructure ensure permissions systems enable seamless management as well as robust permission handling consider business requirements of the entity for the granting of permission, which may include client servicing, compliance or regulatory oversight consider technology functionality needed to ensure rules-based assessment, end-to-end workflow management or outcome-based information capture and notification consider services wrapper needed to maintain the proposed solution, especially in areas such as records management and storage, change management and business continuity.Apply a risk-based approachEntities should ensure that: permission systems do not inadvertently impact the performance, availability, accessibility or other aspects of systems to the detriment of the user experience permission mechanisms do not inadvertently make digital records inaccessible in the long term permissions are suitably applied to production and non-production environments, to ensure appropriate quality assurance of permission handling and protect information contained in those systems.There are also specific non-functional needs that require upfront consideration, for legislative or practical reasons. Any system proposal that does not meet these needs would immediately be deemed unfit for implementation and ruled out of consideration. These needs may include: auditability requirements of process compliance and determination outcomes privacy requirements of individuals, organisations, processes and intellectual property security needs, particularly if the system contains sensitive or personally identifying data or is otherwise likely a target for threat actors.Lower development and maintenance complexity of permissions solutionsEntities are encouraged to work with potential suppliers during design and implementation phases to: minimise the development effort and pathway required, including proof of concept and solution pilots, and de-risk final solution implementation align with and adopt vendor and industry best practice when developing, deploying and applying permissions solutions, particularly incorporating lessons learned from other government entity implementations adopt streamlined maintenance models where the value may reduce overall cost and decrease ongoing management effort without adding additional risk.Ensure the ongoing viability of permissions solutionsThe variety of permissions requirements across government makes it difficult to find a single, centralised solution or a universally applicable pattern. Unique permissions needs will dictate solution selection, design and implementation.Entities should: ensure that their selected solution is supportable, affordable, secure and fit-for-purpose check contractual arrangements, Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) currency and AGA design state in advance of procuring capability maintain their solution to ensure ongoing value and reduce the creation of technical debt.Adhere to reuse principlesReuse content on the Australian Government Architecture provides information for entities on reuse.Entities should: consider permissions-specific functional and non-functional requirements prior to solution design or consideration of technology choice, including: nature of permissions user needs broader system purpose performance and availability requirements privacy and sensitivity concerns meet the requirements of the whole-of-government reuse policy.","exactTitle":"Permissions"},{"id":"314","title":"Permissions","excerpt":"Explore Permissions resources\n","description":"","url":"/capability/permissions/resources/","domain":"","type":"Resources list","subtype":"","content":"Explore Permissions resourcesProcess Contractor reporting, integrity information system (CRIIS)System Australian Taxation Office voice authentication solution Integrated Regulatory Information System (IRIS)","exactTitle":"Permissions"},{"id":"315","title":"Permissions","excerpt":"The permissions policy is essential for evaluating and recording who can access specific government information, systems or resources, and enabling access to users according to their granted permissions.

The recent trend towards direct incorporation of machine learning and large language model systems has the potential to be massively enhanced by the computation power afforded by quantum computing connectivity and processing.As an emerging technology, practical approaches to application of quantum computing are yet to be formed and this standard will be reviewed as progress demands.Comply with legislationEntities must: comply with relevant Commonwealth legislation including (but not limited to): Archives Act 1983 (Cth) Data Availability and Transparency (DAT) Act 2002 (Cth) Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) comply with any other legislation applicable to specific functions and circumstances.Align to best practice and Commonwealth guidelines and standardsEntities must: apply the principles and requirements of the Protective Security Policy Framework throughout their organisation, including in the context of quantum computing not violate the Department of Defence’s export controls on quantum computing technology (as a regulated dual-use technology on the Defence and Strategic Goods List).Entities should: abide by the principles outlined in Guiding principles for a global quantum ecosystem informed by science | Department of Industry Science and Resources maintain awareness of other relevant guidelines, including standards and frameworks, as they are developed across government and in the academic sector.Understand the evolving Commonwealth quantum computing technology environmentEntities should, prior to any internal initiation of quantum research or other investment, engage with the several principal owners that have responsibility for shaping and developing quantum capability, including: The Department of Industry Science and Resources (DISR) which has overall responsibility for Commonwealth policy on quantum. Sitting within this portfolio are the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO), which has a focus on developing quantum for research purposes, and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) which is investigating the commercialisation of quantum research opportunities. DISR in conjunction with the Office of the Chief Scientist were also responsible for shaping and releasing the National Quantum Strategy which was designed to strengthen Australia’s research position while promoting opportunities for commercialisation. The Department of Defence has a special interest in quantum sensing and the use cryptography. Defence’s Next Generations Technology Fund was launched in 2018 to support the development of insights into quantum technologies, with a specific focus on defence related application.Leverage quantum opportunities for governmentEntities investing in quantum should consider the ways in which their investment will fit into the Commonwealth’s enabling of a range of opportunities including: Enabling research: Through Australian Research Council grants and the utilisation of ANSTO and the CSIRO the Commonwealth can bolster the effort going into basic research. This opportunity will allow the government to potentially recoup investment in new research for business and service enablement. Realising economic benefits: Based on a history of quantum innovation there are promising signs for a self-sufficient ecosystem of quantum businesses in Australia. If the government can invest in skills development and the access to emerging quantum technology the conditions favour new business development. Prioritising cybersecurity: Quantum computing is both a threat and a mitigant to securing data stores and data flow. Quantum cryptography has the potential to secure both data areas. Future Commonwealth regulation is recommended to ensure upgraded security capability, as well as advancing the ability to secure its own systems and information flows. Supporting global collaboration: Australia does not yet have the capabilities to scale research into innovation by itself. By capitalising on significant international engagement Government entities can leverage international relationships to build links between researchers.Recognise the forecast timeframe for the development of quantum related technology solutionsQuantum technologies are developing rapidly, and while the full functionality of quantum computing is still emerging, others are already in everyday use.Entities should: be aware that different technologies will mature and be ready for commercial applications at different times over the next 10 years, and beyond align to the National Quantum Strategy, which forecasts the evolution of a range of quantum specific functions over the next 20+ years.Ensure the sustainability of quantum computing solutionsAs an emerging technology, there is critical obligation on entities to take a forward-minded view to investment.Entities should: develop an internal quantum strategy and policy prior, or equivalent, to set clear direction in advance of any other works ensure that their selected solution is supportable, affordable, secure, and fit-for-purpose comprehensively document any work in quantum computing, and make this documentation available to other entities continuously review outcomes against strategic direction, assessing against outcomes and costs, and change direction proactively rather than reflexively.Adhere to reuse principlesThe Australian Government Architecture provides information for entities on Reuse.Entities should: compare their requirements with those of other comparable entities and system functions, and seek to reuse learnings from preceding implementations consider specific functional and non-functional requirements prior to solution design or consideration of technology choice, including: auditability requirements of use cases, processes and/or outcomes privacy requirements of individuals, organisations, processes, or intellectual property security needs, particularly if the system contains sensitive or personally identifying data or is otherwise likely a target for threat actors availability/redundancy, especially in the case of systems supporting round-the-clock needs such as medical or emergency service activities meet the requirements of the Digital and ICT Reuse Policy.","exactTitle":"Quantum Computing"},{"id":"337","title":"Quantum Computing","excerpt":"This policy describes the requirements for entities planning digital investments involving quantum computing.

Any new adoption of new technologies or standards, or development of new components, should enable future reuse while retaining compatibility with other related governmental policy and advice.The Digital and ICT Reuse Standard applies to Non-corporate Commonwealth entities subject to the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013.For corporate Commonwealth entities and wholly owned Commonwealth companies, the standard represents better practice.Reuse guidanceThe Digital and ICT Reuse Policy is underpinned by several themes: engagement, governance, architecture, and operations. As a starting point, entities should: identify their use case requirements and alignment to business capabilities start engagement with key stakeholders and entities that may harbour reusable components early in planning of proposals to identify reuseable capabilities or what is required to be built for reuse establish governance arrangements, including high-level architectures mapping to broadly applicable base capabilities, to ensure objectives are achieved and standards are adhered to throughout the delivery process if building whole-of-government (WofG) capabilities, establish and maintain the WofG base capability as well as the necessary support processes, tools, and guidance to facilitate reuse or onboarding by consuming entities understand factors effecting reuse such as commonality of the use case requirements, existing technology and data environment, scale, and the availability of the reusable content.Understand use case requirementsMany different solutions and platforms are available in government. There is therefore significant opportunity to derive value from previous investment.Entities should: understand specific functional and non-functional use case requirements understand how their own systems requirements can be aligned to existing systems.Use case requirements of specific note may include: alignment to defined business capabilities scale/volume/frequency/availability tactical/strategic nature of solution security/privacy policy mandates existing technological landscape user and client needs/attributes nature of data contained/managed.Architecturally map alignment to business capabilitiesAny technological solution/system can be considered through the lens of the capabilities it enables. The Open Group define a capability as ‘an ability to do something’. A business capability, then, represents the ability for a business to do something.Entities should: map the proposal to the business capabilities it enables, aligning it to policies, standards, and designs (representing previous investment that can be leveraged) adopt an overarching Enterprise Architecture approach that aligns its function and structure to business capabilities, and further to technical solutions and patterns.Consider scale of solution and appropriate licencing/hostingICT applications and solutions commonly used across government, including in the domains of Customer Relationship Management, Case Management, Enterprise Resource Planning, Grant Management, and many others, may be considered in terms of scale (micro/mid/enterprise), and supply/licencing/hosting.Entities should: gain a good understanding of scale, supply, licencing, and hosting related requirements and options available as aligned to vendor offerings: Micro-scale COTS. Locally installed on organisation computers, often with simple extensions to support specific organisational needs and integrations, and generally only supporting standardised, simple solutions and processes. Micro-scale SaaS. Subscription-based and hosted on a hosting provider’s servers. Mostly used by multiple organisations in the same shared technology platform, with limited capacity for custom configurations, deployment, or hosting. Mid-scale SaaS. Similar to Micro-scale SaaS, but with a higher level of organisational configuration and customisation than micro-scale. Allow extension to handle more complex models/transactions/processes, but generally only with a small number of variations and in a simple structure or deployment context. Enterprise-scale SaaS Specific to the organisation (or organisations) they are servicing and often referred to as a “private cloud offering”. A vendor provides the software and technology layer, with contractual responsibility for design, implementation, maintenance, and support. Very high enrolment, and implementation(s) should support high-volume, low-cost unit rates or high-cost specialist transactions, and support multiple customisation and localisation options beyond the vendor’s base offering, as well as allowing for significant scaling and expansion. Subscription-based PaaS A cloud offering that broadens the SaaS model to include the vendor delivering infrastructure for hosting software, data, and other requisite components within the service. Government Platform as a Service (GPaaS) A combination model where government acts as the platform provider and controls the design, implementation, maintenance, and support of combined services. In this model, government may make use of specific SaaS services from enterprise-scale providers, and/or utilise Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), or on-premises (own infrastructure) to deliver a solution. Distinct in that government determines and owns the implementation, the frequency of maintenance and support, and other functionality or lifecycle management. This is a strictly private-to-government arrangement, in which implementation(s) must support high-cost, specialist transactions and may support high-volume, low-cost unit rates. select a solution and arrangement aligned to the needs of the system and organisation.Consider whether a solution is tactical or strategicEntities should: understand whether solutions can be considered as: Strategic: A solution developed to solve a business need in a manner that is ongoing and will receive medium to long-term support. Tactical: A fast-tracked solution designed to solve an urgent need, often delivered with less procedural rigour and in a manner that does not suit a long-term implementation. reuse tactical solutions only for other tactical purposes, and only where components of the existing solution are suitable for re-implementation with minimal rework reuse strategic solutions for strategic or tactical purposes where suitable maintain appropriate documentation highlighting the nature of reuse and plans for managing any incurred technical debt.Reuse whenever possibleEntities should: investigate options to plan for and make use of opportunities for reuse. In line with the Reuse Policy, entities should consider reuse opportunities across the five reuse categories: technology and architecture business capability and process procurement information and data digital and ICT skills and capabilities develop a clear understanding of requirements and align to business capabilities align with Australian Government Architecture (AGA) and engage with entities who have implemented and/or used comparable solutions analyse functions (such as policy, service delivery, legislative or regulatory focuses), as these can be of value in identifying potential options for reuse ensure existing solutions are suitable for reuse through either shared service models, repurposing of existing cloud implementations, or through leveraging of existing patterns suitable to support the use case enable patterns to be available to be consumed through existing Whole of Australian Government arrangements and inter-government Memorandums of Understanding (MoU) assess the suitability of reuse by analysing the requirements of a use case against the capabilities of the asset being reused discourage reuse of existing investment if the effort required to align it to use case requirements outpaces that of implementing a different, strategically-aligned solution.Design and build for reuseEven if an entity cannot reuse an existing investment, they should still ensure that any new elements created are able to be reused by other entities. The consideration of reuse as a requirement when investing in, and maintaining, digital and ICT delivery will help drive lower build and run costs, increase speed and certainty of delivery, and enable interconnectivity of services for people and businesses.Entities should: document and archive patterns and other key system details in an accessible and navigable internal repository standardise data formats and interoperability protocols align architecture to industry standard frameworks such as The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) adhere to industry standards such as Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) adhere to applicable governmental guidelines and non-functional requirements, including those presented on the AGA maintain awareness of best practice for relevant technologies at all levels including technology selection and hosting, data management, software development/quality assurance/deployment, etc. consider how a system may be appropriately modularised to enable repurposing/reuse with minimal rework/risk to the initial system maintain high quality technical documentation throughout works, that can be provided for future reuse develop the necessary support processes, tools, and guidance to facilitate reuse or onboarding by other entities.Minimise Technical DebtTechnical debt is defined as accrued work that is ’owed’ to an IT system, a side effect of software engineering resulting from teams ’borrowing’ against quality by making sacrifices, taking short cuts, or using workarounds to meet delivery deadlines.Entities should: consider technical debt when implementing a solution intended to be reusable consider any instances of reuse as opportunities to remediate previously incurred debt understand the long-term cost of technical debt and budget for future remediations/long term costs associated with short-term solutions ensure new technical debt is taken on in a deliberate manner and tracked/planned for, according to the situational needs and in line with a long-term strategy consider debt management as an ongoing process throughout the delivery lifecycle(s) and analyse and document appropriately establish and maintain the WofG base capability as well as the necessary support processes, tools, and guidance to facilitate reuse or onboarding by consuming entities for WofG capabilities.Enable reuse by othersEntities should ensure anything created is available to those who might derive benefit from it (unless there are legislative/ethical barriers). This may take the form of: senior executive-level engagement across government publishing content as a Design on the Australian Government Architecture (AGA), with clear advice guiding the AGA’s audience on how a component may be reusable, and on the relevant attributes (scale, technology, etc.) publishing content on another suitable repository, such as an API on api.gov.au or an open-source codebase on GitHub clearly articulating, in a manner that suits the sensitivity of any subject matter/data, the component’s fundamental details on your entity’s website, alongside contact details working with other entities to provide them support in their reuse of investment or capability.","exactTitle":"Reuse"},{"id":"342","title":"Revenue receipting capability","excerpt":"Details\n","description":"The Revenue receipting platform is an inbound payments platform designed to receive payments and temporary payments on a large scale.

For guidance on each of the standards, see the Guidance for the Standards for digital sourcing.Standards for digital sourcing is presently in a consulting phase and represents best practice. To contribute to development of this position, please contact architecture@dta.gov.au.Standard statementsThe standards have been organised by stages of sourcing, defined as: pre-procurement drafting requirements approach the market evaluation and negotiation buying and contracting feedback and management.Stage: Pre-procurementImportant digital investment factors are considered before starting a procurement.What is the standard? Buyers consider important digital investment factors before they start a procurement. Buyers are informed that: early consideration of the digital investment factors helps them get the outcome they need they should consider these factors during the strategic planning of their investment outcome. The digital investments factors include: Be user-centred, by involving users from the start of an investment, through to operation and management. Prioritise usability by ensuring the solution is developed to be easy to use. Seek advice from technology, industry and procurement experts who might help to challenge traditional practices and explore new possibilities. Also consider how investments fit into the existing agency and technology environments. Consider the whole-of-life cost of investments, not just the initial purchase price. Align with whole-of-government requirements, including but not limited to: Accessibility Security and Privacy Australian Government Architecture Digital and ICT Reuse For more information on the digital investment factors see Appendix A.How can I implement this standard? Recraft your procurement process by introducing a stage covering planning considerations prior to drafting procurement requirements. See the Digital Sourcing Lifecycle for more information on what a plan stage should include. Ensure buyers are aware the procurement process starts a lot earlier than they may think. Remind buyers the decisions they make prior to starting a procurement strongly influence their investment outcome. Make delegates aware that buyers should consider and incorporate the digital investment factors prior to seeking approval. Provide guidance so that buyers can understand how each factor applies to them. This can be done by linking to the DTA’s guidance or by using the guidance content in internal documentation.Stage: Drafting requirementsRequirements are designed to allow for a range of solutions to deliver business outcomes.What is the standard? Use outcomes focused requirements: Outcomes focused requirements are the default and preferred option, leaving sufficient room for the market to propose solutions. The limited circumstances where technical solutions could be specified are clearly outlined (such as low value, low risk commodity purchases). There is a regular review of the limited circumstance against market offerings, which re-validates the case for each limited circumstance. Creating smaller work packages, where possible, is promoted, helping to ensure businesses of all sizes can offer solutions to government. At a minimum, buyers set up their contracts to follow the Digital Sourcing Contract Limits and Reviews Policy. Make access easy for businesses of all sizes: Buyers provide clear, high-quality information up front to sellers. This includes minimising government jargon and ensuring information is easy to understand for a range of sellers. Buyers cannot specify that having worked with government is a condition of getting work and are discouraged from classifying work with a higher security classification than is required. How can I implement this standard? To support a mindset shift towards using outcomes focused requirements, remind buyers this practice means the market can offer useful solutions they may not be aware of. Include prompts or guidance within Request for Quote (RFQ)/Request for Tender (RFT) templates. Embed practices within internal checklists and guidance. Ensure further guidance is available by linking to the DTA’s guidance or by using the guidance content in internal documentation.Stage: Approach the marketPanels that offer a better experience for buyers and sellers are considered (if using a panel).What is the standard? Buyers are encouraged to evaluate against the list of digital certified panels if a panel is their chosen sourcing mechanism.How can I implement this standard? Encourage buyers to evaluate against the list of digital certified panels in internal templates and/or guidance about approaching the market.Stage: Evaluation and negotiationEvaluations are set up to be fair to all sellers, enabling buyers to find the best opportunities to meet their needs.What is the standard? Buyers are made aware that the best value for money is not necessarily the tender which offers the lowest price. Buyers do not unfairly advantage or disadvantage any tenderer. All tenderers should be afforded equal opportunity. Buyers ensure there is no bias or favouritism, while declaring and managing any conflicts of interest. Buyers maintain clear and transparent records to inform feedback to sellers.How can I implement this standard? Prompt buyers on how to set up their evaluations to be fair in internal evaluation templates, checklists and/or guidance. Ensure further guidance is available by linking to the DTA’s guidance or by using the guidance content in internal documentation.Stage: Buying and contractingProcurement processes are streamlined to minimise burden and attract sellers.What is the standard? Buyers are encouraged to simplify and streamline their procurement. Buyers should: use the minimum number of steps to reach their outcome, reducing processes where possible clearly communicate their procurement process intentions to the market consider the financial impacts of lengthy processes on sellers request only necessary information from sellers use consistent contract templates where applicable (like the Digital Sourcing Contract Template Suite). How can I implement this standard? Encourage buyers to reduce the number of steps used to go to the market. For example, buyers could use an outcomes focused brief instead of a multi-stage Request for Information (RFI)/RFT process. This can combine the Expression of Interest (EOI), RFI, RFQ/RFT stages into one stage. Encourage buyers to use a simpler tender process where possible. This includes encouraging the use of panel arrangements for purchases falling within categories well catered for by panels (e.g. hardware, software, data centres, telecommunications and cloud). Guide buyers to design contracts that focus on the quality of the outcome, with a shared understanding, high-trust partnerships, risk sharing and agreed flexibility in responding to change built in. This can be accomplished by encouraging buyers to: design their approach to market and contract formation stages to focus on what the seller must achieve (the outcomes), rather than how it is achieved (the inputs and outputs). put a greater focus on interactions over processes, responding to change over following a plan and quality of outcomes over number of hours or a set price. Make the procurement process user centred by ensuring that it meets the needs of casual and experienced buyers. Ensure appropriate engagement with risk. This can be done by: having the delegate as close to the decision as possible not making internal processes more restrictive than they need to be (e.g. adding additional layers on top of base CPR requirements) not mandating that buyers must obtain 3 quotes for under procurements under $80,000. Minimise procurement processes that require sellers to provide onerous amounts of information that may not be required.Stage: Feedback and managementSellers are provided useful feedback that helps them improve.What is the standard? Buyers provide useful feedback to sellers following a request for debrief. Feedback: must be detailed enough to help businesses improve their offering the next time they pitch to government should be provided against the broad range of areas and criteria considered in the evaluation process. How can I implement this standard? Provide buyers with guidance on how they can provide feedback. For example, they can provide feedback based on: a comparison of the offer to the evaluation criteria (not in comparison to other offers received) the strengths of the offer the weaknesses of the offer the suitability and attractiveness of the experience, qualifications, referee reports or past performance an indication of cost competitiveness the adequacy of the administrative or management systems any quality management issues the nominated personnel, e.g. number, experience, skills, knowledge, and quality of management.","exactTitle":"Standards for digital sourcing (position)"},{"id":"358","title":"State Revenue Office Victoria integration with myGov","excerpt":"Details\n","description":"The State Revenue Office Victoria hosts My Land Tax, an online application that enables users to manage land tax information and to view, download and pay assessments, update property ownership information","url":"/resource/state-revenue-office-victoria-integration-with-mygov/","domain":"","type":"Resource","subtype":"System","content":"DetailsDirect link: www.sro.vic.gov.au/myGov Responsible agency: State Revenue Office VictoriaThe State Revenue Office Victoria hosts My Land Tax, an online application that enables users to manage land tax information and to: view, download and pay assessments update property ownership information apply for land tax exemptions track the progress of enquiries manage contact details for land tax.My Land Tax can be linked to a user’s myGov account, so that their land tax assessments can be delivered directly to their myGov inbox rather than through the post.AGA Code: DES110Type: DesignCategory: SystemLinked to: CAP1","exactTitle":"State Revenue Office Victoria integration with myGov"},{"id":"359","title":"Support at home: systems enablement  ","excerpt":"Details\n","description":"This is a program to design, build, implement and sustain the ICT changes necessary to enable the Support at home program.

Tablets: Tablets that are part of government ICT assets, including those suitable for donation, reuse or recycling. Mobile phones: Government-issued mobile phones that are ready for disposal, whether for donation or recycling.Devices that are sourced through Device as a Service (DaaS) are out of scope.Apply the guidelinesThese guidelines offer sustainable device management advice with specific considerations for donation and reuse.Plan for device end-of-life during procurementAgencies should: Identify and specify the end-of-life disposal method at the procurement stage Evaluate the environmental impact of disposal methods and prioritise options that minimise harm and promote sustainability, such as donation. Investigate leasing arrangements and consider buyback options, opening new opportunities to donate. Align the donation process with policies supporting the circular economy and the reduction of e-waste, contributing to Australia’s net-zero emissions target. Consider the whole-of-life costs in the procurement process, including decommissioning, remediation and disposal costs Determine the value for money justification to be presented to the delegate to approve. Complete and assess cost and benefit analyses, considering required resourcing and management of a device donation program. Engage with organisations that facilitate device donation Engage with organisations using innovative end-of-life solutions that commit to reducing environmental impacts. Embed requirements within contractual arrangements for suppliers to provide end-of-life management plans. Select vendors that support ethical and sustainable device disposal and ensure these are reflected in contractual arrangements. Further informationDevice end-of-life management is an important part of the overall procurement strategy – plan for how devices will be disposed of or repurposed during procurement.Refurbishing and reusing donated devices extends their lifespan, reducing the need for new electronic products. It helps significantly reduce waste, enhance the circular economy and meet environmental regulations. Agencies should consider the end-of-life management as part of their overall device procurement strategy.Resources Commonwealth Procurement Rules Environmentally Sustainable Procurement Policy Sustainability Procurement GuideEnsure security and sanitisation of devices before donationAgencies must: Implement a thorough sanitisation process involving multiple passes of overwriting data and verification. Use approved sanitisation software to remove data from the device. Ensure screens are inspected for burn-in and image persistence. Document the sanitisation process, including the methods used and verification results. Ensure removal of all security controls and encryption tools before handing over the device. Ensure that the device is cleansed and no residual data remains before donation or disposal. Conduct a thorough risk assessment to identify any potential threats associated with the disposal process. Maintain a record of the devices being donated, including the security measures undertaken prior to donation. Implement protocols to handle any potential mismanagement by partners, including that partners are accredited and adhere to security standards. Conduct a supply chain risk assessment that covers security standards and practices to ensure secure device transport processes are in place. Ensure that the condition of the devices are satisfactory for donation and does not pose any liability to the government. Conduct a proper assessment during the refurbishment to ensure devices are safe and functional for donation and reuse. Ensure devices are supported by the manufacturer with ongoing security and operating system updates mitigating the risk of scams, fraud, and data compromise. Adhere to the Protective Security Policy Framework (PSPF), including Requirement 0097 which mandates that technology assets are disposed of securely in accordance with the controls on the disposal of IT equipment outlined in the Australian Signals Directorate’s Information Security Manual.Agencies should: Consult with other departments and agencies to address any security risks associated with the donation of devices, such as the Australian Signals Directorate and Home Affairs.Further informationAgencies are required to follow strict sanitisation requirements regardless of the end-of-life disposal option they are adopting. This ensures the security of government information.When planning to donate or dispose of devices, agencies must safeguard data in compliance with security policies. This ensures all data is removed to prevent unauthorised access to sensitive information. Before donating or repurposing devices, agencies must inspect them to confirm that all security controls have been implemented correctly.This includes: the mandatory use of approved sanitisation tools and techniques adherence to structured protocols for data erasure verification of successful data destruction.Device cleansing optionsAgencies have the option to self-cleanse their devices or procure the services of a partner organisation to cleanse the devices. Agencies must ensure proper sanitisation before relinquishing control.Proper sanitisation must take place before relinquishing control of a device, this includes sanitisation before any of the following: donation disposal return under a leasing arrangement.Appropriate partner organisationsWhen choosing a partner organisation, agencies must ensure they meet all of the following requirements: they are based in and operate in Australia have the appropriate accreditation to handle the devices securely.Agencies must assess and authorise the partner’s ability to manage security classified data and perform sanitisation. These measures guarantee that no Australian Government data, especially security classified data, is at risk of compromised.Resources Information Security Manual (ISM) Protective Security Policy Framework (PSPF) PSPF Release 2024 Requirements Guidelines for Information Technology EquipmentComply with accountable authority instructions in the PGPA ActAgencies must: Ensure that a Minister or an official of a non-corporate Commonwealth entity is gifting relevant property (as defined in section 8 of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability [PGPA] Act 2013) and confirm: the property was acquired or produced to use as a gift; or the making of the gift is: expressly authorised by law; or is authorised by the Finance Minister in writing; or is made in accordance with any requirements prescribed by the rules. Ensure that the gifting (donating) of devices aligns with the conditions set out in the ‘Disposals and gifting of relevant property document’ from the Department of Finance. Consider whether authorising in a particular gift/donation case would create an onerous or undesirable precedent. Ensure the gift (donation) is publicly defensible and has objective grounds to justify favouring the person or organisation receiving the gift/donation, ahead of other potential recipients. Obtain a reasonable estimate of the market value of the relevant property proposed to be gifted (donated). The delegate must use their discretion in assigning a notional value and must record the basis for determining the value of the property. Follow the PGPA Act when disposing of relevant assets even when their depreciated value is $0. Involve legal, Chief Financial Officer or corporate functions as necessary. Engage with any social and partner organisations to facilitate the donation process and ensure that devices reach the intended recipients. Maintain accurate records and reports about the donation process, ensuring transparency and accountability in line with the PGPA Act requirements. Assess and mitigate any potential risks to the Commonwealth concerning liability for the use of the donated devices. Ensure that upon the gifting or disposal of their device that the agency will hold no further accountability.Further informationWhen donating or disposing of Commonwealth devices, make sure the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (PGPA Act) is followed to ensure proper use and management of public resources.Entities must ensure compliance with relevant accountable authority instructions and internal delegations. Section 66 of the PGPA Act sets out the circumstances where a gift of relevant property may be made by a minister or an official of a non-corporate Commonwealth entity.The Finance Minister’s ability to authorise gifts has been delegated to accountable authorities of all non-corporate Commonwealth entities. This delegation includes specific Directions in relation to authorising gifts. The latest version of the Finance Minister’s delegation to accountable authorities of non-corporate Commonwealth entities can be found on the Department of Finance’s website.Resources: Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 RMG-214 Disposals and gifting of relevant property Disposal and gifting of relevant property case studies Public Governance, Performance and Accountability (Finance Minister to Accountable Authorities of Non-Corporate Commonwealth Entities) Delegation 2022 Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 – SECT 107 Finance Minister Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 – SECT 110 Accountable authority ACTS Interpretation ACT 1901 – SECT 34AAB Minister may authorise others to perform functions or duties or exercise powers on his or her behalfEngage with social and partner organisationsAgencies must: Ensure that upon the gifting or disposal of their device, the agency will hold no further accountability. Assess and mitigate any potential risks to the Commonwealth concerning liability for the use of the donated devices. Depending on the security and sanitisation steps being undertaken prior to relinquishing devices, ensure the partner adheres to required security standards. Assess capability and authorise the partner organisation’s capability to handle classified data and perform thorough sanitisation. Apply PSPF Requirements for sharing security classified information with non-government stakeholders.Agencies should: Research and engage with several not-for-profit organisations that facilitate device donation to ensure the best quality, price, and service tailored to agency needs. Understand the organisation’s history and previous successful device donation programs. Ensure the organisation has the infrastructure to handle the proposed scale of donations, including logistics and distribution networks. Carefully assess the needs of groups, such as low-income families, people in regional, rural and remote areas, individuals with disabilities, or First Nations communities, to maximise the impact of donated devices. Verify if the organisation can distribute devices within your desired regions, whether locally or globally and if any associated costs. Choose organisations that offer additional resources, such as those that provide: ongoing technical support and warranty for donated devices. reports and/or publish information on the use and impact of donated devices. transfer of title when devices are donated to minimise liability concerns. options for a trial period or an exit strategy, such as conducting a pilot program to test the partnership and process before making any long-term commitments. Select organisations that have robust e-waste recycling programs and partnerships with certified recyclers. Maximise the use of donated devices using partners who salvage usable parts from non-functional equipment.Further informationThere are a growing number of organisations dedicated to reducing the digital divide and promoting digital sustainability. Partnering with these organisations can advance your agencies’ sustainability and digital inclusion goals more effectively.By leveraging the expertise and networks of these organisations, your agency can deliver efficient refurbishment and distribution of devices to underserved communities. This enhances digital inclusion and eases the logistical burden on agencies.These partnerships contribute to environmental sustainability by reducing electronic waste through recycling and reuse initiatives. Selecting the right organisation for an agency’s device sanitisation and donation involves more than just handing over devices at the end of their lifecycle. It requires careful consideration of the organisation’s practices and overall impact in: data security reputation technical support sustainability.By choosing an organisation with a comprehensive and ethical approach, agencies can ensure that donations make a lasting and positive impact.Resources Corporate partnerships and charities | ACNC Governance Toolkit: Working with partners | ACNC PSPF Information SharingMeet reporting requirementsAgencies must: Meet the requirements of the Environmentally Sustainable Procurement Policy (ESP Policy), if procurement falls within scope. Understand at procurement what the end-of-life option is for the disposal of devices. Submit data, including device disposal details, to the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW). Consider developing consistent reporting processes to effectively track the end-of-life status of devices.Further informationWhere procurements fall within scope of the ESP Policy, agencies are required to report on the end-of-life management of their device.Reporting must be in line with DCCEEW’s ESP Policy Reporting Framework. DCCEEW collects data on the number of assets disposed of, their reuse, and whether they are sold or donated.Resources ESP Policy Reporting Framework PSPF Section 11 - Information Disposal PSPF Section 13.7 - Technology Asset DisposalRoles and responsibilities       Who Roles and responsibilities   Australian Signals Directorate The Australian Signals Directorate is responsible for: * the Information Security Manual which is a cyber security framework that an organisation can apply, using their risk management framework, to protect their information technology and operational technology systems, applications and data from cyberthreats.   Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) DCCEEW is responsible for administering the ESP Policy, including: * providing guidance to support agencies and suppliers. * building capability in environmentally sustainable procurement through education and advocacy. * promoting and raising awareness of the policy. * publishing whole of government performance against the policy. * evaluating the policy’s effectiveness using key performance indicators. * creating performance metrics for procurement categories. * assisting tenderers and suppliers in understanding policy requirements.   Department of Finance The Department of Finance is responsible for: * managing frameworks and policies and providing advice to support the proper use and management of public resources. * managing the Commonwealth Procurement Framework including the Commonwealth Procurement Rules and AusTender. * providing advice to relevant agencies on the procurement framework.   Digital Transformation Agency (DTA) The DTA is responsible for: * managing and maintaining the guide. * providing guidance and support to agencies. * promoting and raising awareness of the guide. * leveraging DCCEEW’s reporting framework to assess the effectiveness of the guide.   Department of Home Affairs The Department of Home Affairs is responsible for: * the PSPF, which mandates protective security requirements for all non-corporate Commonwealth entities, including on managing security risks in procurement and technology asset disposal.   Relevant Agencies Relevant agencies are responsible for: * ensuring alignment to the ESP Policy and the guide. * understanding at procurement what the end-of-life option is for the disposal of devices. * Submitting data to DCCEEW which includes device disposal details.   Definitions     Term Definition Commonwealth entity Has the same meaning as set out in the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013. The PGPA Flipchart is a reference of all non-corporate and corporate Commonwealth entities and Commonwealth companies. Donation Generally, a donation is understood as a gift given to a cause or organisation, often charitable, without expecting anything in return. For the purposes of Commonwealth entities, donations might be treated similarly to gifts, subject to the same rules and expectations for proper use and management of public resources. End-of-life “End-of-life” in this guide refers to the stage in a device’s life cycle when it is no longer usable or needed for government use, and decisions are made regarding its disposal, recycling, or repurposing. Manufacturers end-of-life is when tech companies cease providing software and security updates and the devices are no longer supported. We do not support devices being donated at the end of the manufacturer’s life. Gift A gift refers to relevant property that is given to someone without payment. Information The PSPF defines information as: Physical documents/papers, electronic/digital data or intellectual information (knowledge) that is owned, managed or maintained by the entity. It includes details of methodologies, classified military/intelligence activities or operations, diplomatic discussions and negotiations. Recycling Recycling is the action or process of converting waste into reusable material. Relevant property Property (other than relevant money) that is owned or held by the Commonwealth or a corporate Commonwealth entity Relevant property in this guide refers to all in scope devices even when its value has depreciated to $0, as section 66 would still apply. Reuse Reuse can have several definitions. “Reuse” in this guide refers to devices are refurbished to be either donated or sold. This gives a second life for the equipment. If devices are unsuitable for reuse, the device can still be recycled for parts. Social organisation Social organisations are organisations that operate with the primary goal of addressing social issues and improving community well-being. They often work in nonprofit sectors and focus on providing support and services to vulnerable populations. Examples include charities, nonprofits, and community groups. Reference to social organisation in this guide refers to organisations that facilitate the donation of devices to vulnerable community groups. Partner organisations Partner organisations are organisations that collaborate with other organisations (like government agencies) to achieve shared goals, particularly in projects requiring expertise or resources that a single entity may lack. Partners can be from various sectors, including private companies, nonprofits, and other governmental bodies. They play a crucial role in facilitating the implementation and success of joint initiatives. Reference to partner organisation in this guide refers to organisations where agencies have outsourced the sanitisation and cleansing process of devices.

A voluntary scheme, the TDIF set out rules and standards around privacy, security, transparency, trust and choice to be followed by accredited organisations.Based on globally recognised best practices and standards, the TDIF informed the development of the Digital ID Act 2024.ApplicabilityThe TDIF has been superseded by the Australian Government Digital ID System (AGDIS) and a new accreditation scheme established by the Digital ID Act 2024.TDIF Identity Proofing LevelsIdentity Proofing Levels were an accreditation standard within the TDIF.Identity Proofing Level 1Identity Proofing Level 1 (IP1) was used when no identity verification was needed or when a very low level of confidence in the claimed identity was needed. This level supported self-asserted identity (I am who I say I am) or pseudonymous identity.IP1 was for services where the risks of not undertaking identity verification would have a negligible consequence to the individual or the service. For example, to pay a parking infringement or obtain a fishing licence.Identity Proofing Level 1 PlusIdentity Proofing Level 1 Plus (IP1 Plus) was used when a low level of confidence in the claimed identity was needed. This required one identity document to verify a claim to an existing identity.IP1 Plus was for services where the risks of getting identity verification wrong would have minor consequences to the individual or the service. For example, the provision of loyalty cards.Identity Proofing Level 2Identity Proofing Level 2 (IP2) was used when a low-medium level of confidence in the claimed identity was needed. It required two or more identity documents to verify a claim to an existing identity.IP2 was for services where the risks of getting identity verification wrong would have moderate consequences to the individual or the service. For example, the provision of utility services. An Identity Proofing Level 2 Identity check was similar to the traditional “100-point check”.Identity Proofing Level 2 PlusIdentity Proofing Level 2 Plus (IP 2 Plus) was used when a medium level of confidence in the claimed identity was needed. It required two or more identity documents to verify a claim to an existing identity and required the binding objective to be met.IP2 Plus was for services where the risks of getting identity verification wrong would have moderate-high consequences to the individual or the service. For example, undertaking large financial transactions.Identity Proofing Level 3Identity Proofing Level 3 (IP 3) was used when a high level of confidence in the claimed identity was needed. It required two or more identity documents to verify a claim to an existing identity and required the binding objective to be met.IP3 was for services where the risks of getting identity verification wrong would have high consequences to the individual or the service. For example, access to welfare and related government services.Identity Proofing Level 4 (IP 4)Identity Proofing Level 4 (IP 4) was used when a very high level of confidence in the claimed identity was needed. It required four or more identity documents to verify a claim to an existing identity. The individual claiming the identity had to attend an in-person interview and meet the requirements of IP 3.IP 4 was for services where the risks of getting identity verification wrong would have very high consequences to the individual or the service. For example, the issuing of government-issued documents like an Australian passport.TDIF Credential LevelsCredential Levels were an accreditation standard within the TDIF.Credential Level 1Credential Level 1 (CL1) provided a basic authentication credential suitable for use at the IP1 proofing level. This allowed single-factor authentication, e.g. password.Credential Level 2Credential Level 2 (CL2) provided a strong authentication credential suitable at the IP1, IP2 and IP3 proofing levels. This required two-factor authentication, e.g. password with additional one-time password.Credential Level 3Credential Level 3 (CL3) provided a very strong authentication credential, suitable at the IP1, IP2, IP3 and IP4 levels. This required two-factor authentication and hardware verification.Accreditation StandardsAttribution ProviderAttribute Provider was an accreditation standard within the TDIF.Attributes are additional information about a person or business such as entitlements or characteristics (for example, that an individual had a particular qualification). Attribute providers generated and managed attributes and claims about an individual, business or organisation that were provided to reliant services.Identity ExchangeThe TDIF Identity Exchange was an accreditation standard within the TDIF.

It is often achieved through implementation of a Content Management System (CMS).A CMS helps an entity create, publish, manage, store, and modify their digital content, generally comprising: a flexible interface that allows for the presentation of content to the user through an approval functionality, typically known as publishing an administrative backend linked to a persistent database, where an administrator can create, organise, and publish content available to the user interface, as well as undertaking other administrative functions.The CMS backend is generally managed through a web interface, enabling the administrative or designated user to publish, update, or delete content with minimal need for code modifications.Comply with legislation and regulationEntities must: comply with relevant Commonwealth legislation including (but not limited to): Archives Act 1983 (Cth) Data Availability and Transparency (DAT) Act 2002 (Cth) Disability Discrimination Act 1992(Cth) Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Cth) Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) comply with any other legislation applicable to specific functions and circumstances.Align to guidelines and standardsEntities must: meet the requirements of the Hosting Certification Framework (please refer to Hosting for more information) meet the Digital Experience Policy (DX Policy) and its standards adhere to the Australian Government Style Manual, that sets the criteria for Australian Government writing and editing align to the Australian Government Branding Guidelines meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 Level AA meet the standards set by the Australian Cyber Security Centre for hosting web content apply the principles and requirements of the Protective Security Policy Framework throughout their organisation, including in the context of web content management.Entities should: define internal, entity-wide mandatory standards, and associated templates, to ensure consistency between different outputs and channels ensure human-centred design practices are applied when writing, hosting, and managing content leverage Australian Government technology options and anticipate how emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence impact, will impact web content accessibility ensure compatibility with assistive technologies such as keyboard inputs, voice commands and screen readers use automated accessibility testing where appropriate, in addition to testing content with individuals produce clear, coherent, and inclusive content that serves the users’ needs.Deliver web content on digital channelsEntities should: create an entity-wide channel strategy that considers user needs and entity-wide strategic direction in clearly directing content to specific channels avoid the proliferation of digital channels by consolidating like-type services onto single platforms improve government content by adopting a digital-first approach such as publishing informational content through entities websites as a primary option offer content in different mediums, such as text, images and audio and segment long documents or tutorials into chunks provide human-validated multilingual support for important information where multiple channels exist, support users to move between them at boundary points incorporate user-centred design in the evaluation, deployment/development, and testing of content and platforms, particularly with users who depend on assistive technology.Develop a content strategyThe APSC’s Digital Profession provides reference materials for development of a content strategy: Content Strategy Guide | Digital ProfessionEntities should: define an entity-wide, service, or topic-centric content strategy, that covers: an overarching approach that consolidates and clarifies the roles of different digital channels appropriate alignment of content to different digital channels an overarching governance model, including alignment of responsibilities between technical and business teams define universal content rules in line with common conventions across government set expectations for specific governance of individual digital channels work towards a content governance model to improve and report on outcomes and efficiencies apply this content strategy when building new services or redesigning content, or for substantial changes such as machinery-of-government updates manage content across its lifecycle (the people, workflow, skills, and tasks involved in producing content) establish roles and responsibilities for content management to promote balanced collaboration among various subject matter experts within the government.Align business, operational, and technological needsThere are numerous CMS available, and each has its own unique user experience and feature set. Because current CMS facilitates the creation and management of content with little to no coding, it is important to identify the right CMS to address the business requirements.Entities must implement a CMS with: the ability to create, edit, revise, audit and publish content in line with Archives Act 1983 the ability to have roles-based access control to minimise risk to both content administration and user access, in line with identity management best practice and Permissions | aga (digital.gov.au) committed ongoing support in the form of continuous security updates and patches.
