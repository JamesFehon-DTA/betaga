## The AGA domain and capability model  

The AGA Domain and Capability Model groups government digital and ICT capabilities into an integrated set of domains.  

[Download the AGA Domain and capability model (PDF XXXkB)](). 

## Discover advice through capabilities 
Use capabilities to discover mandatory and recommended advice, based on what your digital investment or project needs to achieve.

Each capability surfaces advice and guides, examples, and reusable platforms and components. They are grouped into themes relevant to fulfilling that capability.

Capabilities also help you access whole of government policies, rules and frameworks, if they have a specific connection to the capability.

## Apply better practices with policies and standards 
Read a capability’s policy and standard to get advice on how to build the capability within your agency.

AGA policies and standards are authored by the Digital Transformation Agency. AGA policies and standards are not enforced by legislation or Cabinet, unlike whole of government policies, rules, standards and frameworks, but provide informed advice curated through a [system wide governance process]().
