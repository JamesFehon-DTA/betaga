## Our strategic purpose 

The Australian Government is committed to delivering simple, secure and connected services through world-class digital capabilities, as outlined in the Data and Digital Government Strategy. 
 
The AGA supports this vision by helping agencies: 
- develop high-quality digital solutions and services 
- reuse existing solutions and reduce duplication 
- align with government priorities.  

The AGA also provides guidance to help agencies meet the requirements of the investment process and the Whole of Government Digital and ICT Investment Oversight Framework (IOF). The IOF ensures digital investments are well planned, aligned with strategic priorities and deliver value for money.

## Benefits for agencies 

AGA resources support every stage of digital project development by outlining mandatory requirements – including reuse – and explaining the government standard for digital delivery. 

You can use AGA resources to:  
- prepare digital investment proposals and business cases 
- check mandatory policies and obligations 
- find solution-specific guidance 
- discover reusable assets. 

## Inside the AGA 

The guidance in the AGA is organised by distinct topics known as capabilities.   

Each capability includes: 

- obligatory [policies, rules and frameworks]()
- useful [advice and guides](), including vendor and open-source resources 
- [reusable platforms]() and technologies 
- [examples and case studies]() of digital done well.
