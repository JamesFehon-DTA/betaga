## Agency benefits
If you are bringing forward a digital or ICT-enabled proposal for consideration through the budget process, you need to meet certain requirements under the Whole-of-government digital and ICT investment oversight framework (IOF).
The IOF helps ensure that government’s digital investments are well-planned, aligned with strategic priorities and delivering value for money.
* Find out your obligations under the IOF
* Learn how you can use the AGA to complete IOF processes
* Get more information on IOF applicability

## Strategic purpose
There are several whole-of-government policies that apply to all digital and ICT investments. These are mandatory for government agencies depending on:
* whether your agency is a corporate or non-corporate Commonwealth entity
* the total cost of your investment
* the cost of the digital component of your project. 
* Find out which mandatory policies apply to your investment

## Find guidance to support your proposal
The Australian Government Architecture (AGA) contains policies, standards, guides and resources to support your project planning.
Use the guidance within the AGA to inform your investment and complete your proposal and business case.
