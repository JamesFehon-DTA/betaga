The principles apply across all channels, whether people are interacting with government and its services online, on the phone or in person.When working on a policy, program, or behind the scenes, the principles can be applied at every stage of the process – from development to design and implementation.&lt;p&gt;The principles are evidence-based, developed through extensive consultation, user research and review of best practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, the seven principles support the APS to ‘put people and business at the centre of policy and services’. They do this by encouraging:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a good understanding of people’s needs early in the program/project lifecycle&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;consistent consideration of customer and staff experiences&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;streamlined service delivery across government.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The principles are designed to work hand in hand with the Digital Service Standard, within the Digital Experience Policy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were developed as part of the APS Reform Agenda to deliver better outcomes for the community and contribute to a fairer, more inclusive Australia. They also build on the APS Vision for User-Centred Service Excellence: ‘Reliable and accessible services, when and how you need them’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Applicability &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The APS Experience Design Principles were developed by Services Australia and the Australian Public Service Commission for use across the public service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are endorsed by the executive Partnership Priorities Committee for use by non-corporate Commonwealth entities.

However, it may be applicable in circumstances where these Experience Level APIs are re-exposed for wider consumption.Understand the evolving API technology environmentEntities should:prioritise REST (Representational State Transfer) as the basis for design, noting its ‘core’ position as the de-facto mechanism of data representation and transfer to and from systems on the internetconsider emerging alternatives such as GraphQL for streaming data or function-based APIs, where REST APIs typically are not suitableavoid implementation of outdated/superseded API types such as SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)retire/replace older API types such as SOAP where they are presently in usemonitor emerging trends when developing API solutions.Recent shifts in the API architecture and design have included the evolution of API gateways from proprietary, supplier owned and managed interfaces to open-sourced alternatives offered at little or no cost. These offerings reduce implementation cost and provide greater flexibility in interconnecting other APIs and systems.API design is evolving to incorporate the segmentation of API data functionality into either control streams or pure data, ensuring the optimisation of data flow through the API. The technology movement in both API domains provide an opportunity for Commonwealth entities to enhance interoperability, reduce implementation costs and optimise data transfer functionality. There is also a recent trend towards direct incorporation of Machine Learning and Large Language Model systems that will be inherently dependent on API connectivity.Lower development and maintenance complexity&nbsp;Entities should:ensure that their selected solution is supportable, affordable, secure, and fit-for-purposeconsider the suitability of low-code / no-code development paths prior to the use of more contemporary API development approaches.API solutions can be implemented using a low-code/no-code development approach that uses human-centred functionality to rapidly define, test, integrate, and present complex processes and rulesets in a modular and repeatable manner, with minimal use of programming languages.Contemporary API solutions adopting a low-code / no-code approach can benefit from the removal of layers between an analyst’s expertise and the solution. Direct engagement between the analyst and the platform can help optimise the end-to-end process or integrate the needs of a stakeholder. Benefits of this approach include rapid development, a better-understood and more refined business process and enhanced stakeholder satisfaction.Determine an API release, fair use, and distribution strategyEntities must:define and document an API release, fair use and distribution strategycontrol and document release and distribution on a per-API basis.Entities should:ensure a transparent approach to the release of APIs, around fair and reasonable use of the API and access to all associated dataprovide clear guidance on how APIs may be made available, including any supply costs.Commonwealth entities have invested in the substantial development of system APIs.

This can be achieved through regular updates and strategic meetings, as well as through detailed reporting, such as real-time dashboards that provide insights into key performance metrics and operational challenges. Finance teams&nbsp;need to identify the budget owners, forecast the costs for each budget owner, and monitor the actual versus predicted costs on a regular basis. Product owners&nbsp;need to forecast and track the cloud costs related to their product, and account for those costs within the profit and loss. They need to understand the business changes that can impact their predicted costs, and track value metrics to ensure they are getting an efficient service.IT leadership&nbsp;need to ensure that the cloud FinOps strategy is incorporated into the cloud strategy and ensure an effective cloud FinOps service. They need to establish optimisation priorities, define technical controls and processes, so that they can track the trends, identifying and responding to any anomalous costs.Engineering teams&nbsp;need to be aware of their service costs and have defined routes for the technical optimisation of their services. They need to be alerted to irregular or unplanned costs and either take corrective action or communicate the changes and their value. The running cost needs to be considered as part of the design process when developing or refreshing systems to enable optimum design decisions.The needs of stakeholders should be realised via clear and traceable requirements, that are maintained as fundamental to further implementation works.Comply with legislationWhen establishing cloud FinOps practices, entities should ensure legislative compliance and embed visibility and legislative traceability into the operating model itself. This approach ensures compliance and legislative alignment is core to all cloud deployments and makes audits efficient.&nbsp;Any domain-specific legislation relevant to the context of the entity/cloud investment should be considered alongside core pieces of legislation including the:Archives Act 1983&nbsp;(Cth)Data Availability and Transparency (DAT) Act 2002&nbsp;(Cth)Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act&nbsp;2013&nbsp;(Cth)Research and assess practices and solutionsAll entities should conduct their own requirements gathering and follow an objective assessment of platform suitability utilising whole-of-government (WofG) procurement panels, guidance and tool kits.Researching and assessing cloud FinOps solutions is crucial, particularly as this is an emerging capability in which vendor offerings are also rapidly evolving. Thorough research allows entities to understand the diverse range of solutions and tools available, helping to make informed decisions to optimise cost management, enhance resource utilisation and compatibility with existing systems.Incrementally improve strategies&nbsp;Entities should incrementally establish a central cloud FinOps function to provide coordination and information between stakeholders involved in cloud operations. Making multiple small scale, quick actions with limited scope allows FinOps teams to assess the outcomes of their actions, and gain insights into the value of taking further action.Reuse previous investmentEntities should seek to reuse existing investment where suitable, and prudentially consider whether the efficacy of a given implementation method will meet entity needs. When selecting a cloud FinOps model, tool, or platform for reuse, entities should:understand their use-case specific functional and non-functional requirements, including volume and nature of data, broader system purpose, performance matters, and privacy/sensitivity concernsconsider existing and future technological landscape and interoperability needsinvestigate previous investment within your entity and across government and seek to reuse where suitableensure any investment is contemporary and viable for long-term use.If existing options in the capability are not suitable, consideration should be given to the reusability of relevant processes and practices derived from related AGA capabilities.There are several existing governance frameworks developed for other AGA capabilities, that may lend themselves to developing cloud FinOps policies and practices. Entities may also explore the FinOps Framework, established by the&nbsp;FinOps Foundation, which provides an operating model that it considers a baseline for establishing excellent FinOps practice.Build for reuse and the long-term useDeveloping a cloud FinOps system with broad applicability across entities, and a future-focus that enables long term support and viability, is critical for reducing risk, increasing efficiency, and supporting consistent implementation across government.Any new system should be designed with a modular and scalable architecture, allowing for future integration into other structures. Emphasising interoperability and standardisation, in both technologies and data formats, ensures adaptability across different entities. Additionally, user-friendly interfaces and comprehensive documentation should be incorporated to facilitate ease of implementation and use. This will allow for a streamlining of processes, promoting and fostering consistency across entities and aligning with best practice in non-government organisations."},{"id":"33","title":"Cloud Financial Optimisation (Cloud FinOps)","excerpt":"This policy describes the requirements for entities planning digital investments and adopting cloud financial optimisation practices and solutions.&nbsp; Applicability Digital investment proposals are assessed against this policy by the DTA through the&nbsp;Digital and ICT Investment Oversight Framework (IOF).

However, this approach can also &nbsp;add complexity, and raise the chance of misconfigurations, insecure interfaces, and other security breaches.Edge computing which reduces latency, optimises bandwidth, and enhances privacy and security through balancing cloud operations with a degree of localised data processing. It offers scalability and flexibility by distributing workloads more efficiently and ensures resilience and reliability in scenarios with intermittent connectivity. Cost effectiveness may also be achieved by minimising data transfer and storage needs in the cloud, particularly benefiting data intensive applications, however this is at the cost of potentially increased complexity and cost of maintenance of local and cloud infrastructures.Sustainability in cloud computing is gaining attention.

Adopting a human-centred design approach ensures services meet populations’ needs by being as accessible and user friendly as possible.The Digital service standard v2.0 is a set of best-practice principles to help entities design and build digital services that are simple, clear, and fast. Following the Digital service standard ensures digital services provide public value and meet user needs, with ongoing service improvements based on evidence and learnings.Adopt a consistent, effective and efficient approach for identifying businesses and individuals participating in e-marketsE-markets may facilitate the exchange of sensitive data between multiple parties who may have had no previous relationship with each other. As such, it is critical that both parties are authorised, and where possible identity-verified, to reduce the risk of inadvertent access or damage to sensitive data.Businesses are encouraged to create authorisations for employees and other individuals who work on behalf of the business. Businesses are responsible for maintaining the integrity of their records. Using global authentication gateways such as PRODA (Provider digital access) is recommended.&nbsp;Businesses and individuals using e-markets should be verified by an identity system. An identify system is an online environment for identity management transactions governed by a set of system rules (also referred to as a trust framework) where individuals, organisations, services and devices can trust each other because authoritative sources establish and authenticate their identities.Relevant identity exchange/attribute provider accreditation standard models that should be considered in e-markets design include the Australian Government digital ID system (AGDIS).User data is at the core of e-markets. E-market solutions should:protect user privacy by ensuring that practices relating to the collection and use of user data are lawful, transparent, fair, enable user participation and choice, and provide reasonable security safeguardsmanage digital security risk and implement security measures for reducing or mitigating adverse effects relating to user participation in e-markets.The Australian Signals Directorate produces the Information security manual (ISM). The purpose of the ISM is to outline a cyber security framework that entities can apply to protect their systems, including those related to e-markets, and associated data from cyber threats. Details in the ISM can be accessed here:&nbsp;Information security manual (ISM).Ensure e-markets are used to provide products and services in a manner that prevents unfair conduct&nbsp;Businesses and individuals should adopt fair practices when building and engaging in e-markets by:not engaging in conduct that is unfair or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceivenot making false or misleading representations about the products or services they supplynot engaging in unconscionable conduct (such as collecting data from competitors on price on products or services)ensuring that there is clear demonstration of intent to buy or sell products or offer servicesensuring participating businesses are compliant with fair trading laws and operating fairly and competitively. Fair trading laws ensure that businesses inform and protect customers.The participating businesses should consider:Fair trading lawsThe&nbsp;Australian Consumer Law and your businessThe&nbsp;Competition and Consumer ActAustralian standardsCodes of conduct.When selling products or services, businesses need to understand and be compliant with:Australia's trade measurement lawsDisplaying pricesProduct labellingSecure card paymentsWarranties and refunds.Australian product safety laws apply to e-markets and at every stage of the supply chain. These laws mean that participating businesses:must comply with&nbsp;Australian mandatory safety standardsmust not supply banned productsmust&nbsp;report the death or serious injury or illness&nbsp;of a person that occurred as a result of a consumer product supplied by the vendorshould immediately&nbsp;recall a product&nbsp;if it may present a safety hazard, does not comply with a safety standard, or is banned – and notify the Australian Commonwealth Minister responsiblemust comply with any recall notices issued under the&nbsp;Australian Consumer Lawshould be aware that compliance with international or other trusted safety standards does not automatically mean compliance with Australian safety standards or bans.It is businesses’ responsibility to understand Australian product safety laws and make sure they sell safe, compliant products. These obligations have been summarised by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.See:&nbsp;Selling online | Product Safety Australia.Address data and information privacy and legislative requirementsE-market users should respect privacy by providing clear information about how personal data is handled. Businesses must use and store personal information responsibly, ensuring customer consent, proper security, and anonymisation where appropriate. These practices follow the Australian Privacy Principles, which offer flexible, technology-neutral guidelines for handling personal data.&nbsp;There are key legislative regimes governing digital information assets of Commonwealth entities:The&nbsp;Archives Act 1983 (Cth), aimed at imposing record keeping obligations in respect of Commonwealth records. Digital information assets used in government business are Commonwealth records to be managed in accordance with the Archives Act 1983 (Cth).The&nbsp;Data Availability and Transparency (DAT) Act 2022 (Cth) is intended to improve public sector data accessibility, facilitate its consistent sharing with privacy safeguards, enhance integrity and transparency, instil confidence in its use, and establish institutional sharing arrangements.The&nbsp;Privacy Act&nbsp;1988 (Cth) is intended to promote and protect the privacy of individuals and to regulate how Australian Government agencies and organisations with an annual turnover of more than $3 million, and some other organisations, handle personal information.There are other key pieces of legislation that may apply depending on the operating context of an entity and information set. Each entity should review relevant federal, state and local requirements to ensure full compliance.&nbsp;For additional information see:&nbsp;Information asset management and Privacy protection.Adhere to reuse principlesNumerous instances of e-market solutions and platforms exist across government, several of which may be suitable for reuse through either shared service models, creating new instances of existing cloud implementations, or leveraging existing patterns. Using existing e-marketplaces is preferred to the development of new platforms.Reuse and reuse potential are also enhanced by greater uniformity in data structures, specifically where data is organised and stored in a consistent manner, and uniformity in integration protocols is developed and maintained.Agencies should look for the existing reusable designs on the AGA website, get in direct contact with entities with comparable use cases, or leverage the existing WofG arrangements and inter-government memorandums of understanding.&nbsp;The Australian Government Architecture provides information for entities on reuse."},{"id":"72","title":"E-markets","excerpt":"Explore E-markets resources\n","description":"E-Markets are systems or platforms that digitally connect or link users to the provisioning of products or services.

This will include access to Quantum computing facilities as these become available.There is a general distinction between HPC resources required for the research &amp; development of models, including AI LLM training, and the deployment of those models for inference uses in operational settings, which does not necessarily require HPC facilities or sovereign capacity.&nbsp;Australia’s research competitivenessResearch is becoming increasingly reliant on computational capacity, and there is a growing correlation between researchers’ access to HPC resources and the global competitiveness of that research. For Australia’s research competitiveness going forward, Commonwealth entities should consider the positive effects of supporting Australian HPC research facilities through utilisation of those facilities where appropriate.&nbsp;Australia’s trade interestsTo support Australian industry and ensure Australia’s continuing participation in global supply chain and value chain activities associated with HPC, Commonwealth entities should support Australian owned and operated HPC facilities wherever possible.Access HPC resources utilising shared facilities available to Commonwealth entitiesSeveral HPC facilities and resources have been developed across government, including within non-corporate and corporate Commonwealth entities.Entities should:consider accessing existing HPC resources available to the APS via:HPC facilities directly owned by non-corporate Commonwealth entities, including:the Bureau of Meteorology’s weather forecasting-oriented supercomputing facilitiesdefence hosted HPC resources - for entities in the Defence portfolio, please contact architecture@dta.gov.au for detailsCommonwealth-funded HPC facilities in the research environment, including:the CSIRO’s Commonwealth owned and operated facilities and National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS) funded research facilitiesthe Australian National University’s (ANU’s) National Computing Infrastructure (NCI), including ‘Gadi’ and other supercomputing facilitiesseveral ‘tier 2’ supercomputing research facilities, owned and operated by universities that are not Commonwealth entities, but available through various access schemes.Whole-of-Government procurement arrangements with industry, including:DTA-administered ICT procurement marketplaces and whole-of-government contract arrangements, including both cloud-oriented and on-premises HPC products and services.&nbsp;In considering existing HPC resources available to the Commonwealth, entities should:map their unique requirements against the attributes of these facilitiesinvestigate potential for utilisation of these facilities prior to considering other procurementwhere existing facilities are not suitable, clearly document why this is the case, as part of any proposals to utilise non-government-owned, or develop bespoke, HPC facilitiesif utilising cloud providers for HPC functionality, procure via BuyICT and the whole-of-government contracts.Align to guidelines and standardsEntities must:comply with the Hosting Certification Framework to ensure cloud-oriented HPC services are hosted in certified tenancies/data centresapply the principles and requirements of the Protective Security Policy Framework throughout their organisation, including in the context of High Performance Computing.Entities should:apply a risk-based approach to cyber security, where it comes to HPC facilities, to align with the Information Security Manual (ISM).Adhere to reuse principlesThe Australian Government Architecture provides information for entities on Reuse.When utilising existing HPC facilities, entities should:document their use case, including specifics such as data types and volumesdefine success measures prior to utilisationrecord as a pattern the process of utilisationassess and document outcomes against these success measuresmake documentation available to other entities to enable future reuse.When investing in new HPC facilities, entities should:ensure these are built to provide maximum value to the Australian Government, including potential provision of shared access or re-use for other Commonwealth entitiesclearly document planning and design artefacts, processes, specifications, risk assessments and investment decisionsenable, as much as is appropriate within legislative and practical constraints, future opportunities to share or re-use facilities across the APSmeet the requirements of the Digital and ICT Reuse Policy."},{"id":"100","title":"High performance computing","excerpt":"Explore High performance computing resources\n","description":"High Performance Computing (HPC) refers to the practice of employing advanced computing techniques, typically utilising parallel processing and supercomputers, to solve complex problems that require significant computational power and data storage capabilities.

It ensures that applications are developed and maintained with security in mind, protecting sensitive information assets and preventing unauthorised access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of those assets. It is critical this standard be considered alongside those of complementary capabilities:Application SecurityNetwork SecurityPermissions.Align to guidelines and standardsEntities must:apply the principles and requirements of the&nbsp;Protective security policy framework&nbsp;(PSPF) throughout their organisationmeet the requirements of the&nbsp;Hosting certification framework (HCF).Entities should consider and align, where suitable, to security frameworks across Government, including:Information security manualStrategies to mitigate cyber security incidents.Entities should also consider the following from organisations outside of the APS:ISO/IEC 27001 defines requirements an information security management system ISMS must meet.The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) provides comprehensive resources in relation to data security, including the&nbsp;OWASP data security top 10&nbsp;which outlines the key security risks for storing and moving sensitive and personally identifiable information, the challenges involved and how to overcome them.Be secure-by-designEntities should:take a&nbsp;secure-by-design&nbsp;approach to information asset security as defined and recommended by the Australian Signals Directorateimplement&nbsp;Essential Eight Maturity Level 2&nbsp;mitigations as a minimumimplement&nbsp;ISM controls&nbsp;within the defined areas of:application controlpatch applicationsconfigure Microsoft Office macro settingsuser application hardeningrestrict administrative privilegespatch operating systemsmulti-factor authenticationregular backups.Align operational and technological needsEntities should:design information asset security measures and solutions to integrate seamlessly with an entity’s existing security infrastructure to provide layered securityunderstand the specific type of information being handled and tailor security measures accordinglyuse trusted suppliers, vetted as part of cyber supply chain risk management assessmentsrecord suppliers on their approved supplier list once vettedadopt advanced encryption methods, secure communication protocols and intrusion detection systems to safeguard both data in transit and data at restensure security solutions for information assets are scalable and flexible to adapt to evolving threats and technological advancementsintegrate security awareness and training programs, as human factors may pose a significant risk to the security of information assets.Apply a risk-based approachEntities should:be careful to ensure that security mechanisms do not inadvertently impact the performance, availability, accessibility or other aspects of systems to the detriment of the user experiencebe careful to ensure that security and authentication mechanisms do not inadvertently make digital records inaccessible in the long termprioritise security considerations throughout all stages of the software delivery lifecycle, including when architecting, developing, testing and deploying applicationsintegrate security awareness and training programsdemonstrate and foster a culture of security among their employees.Select and implement appropriate information asset security controlsThe Australian Government uses four security classifications:OFFICIAL: SensitivePROTECTEDSECRETTOP SECRETAll other information from business operations and services is OFFICIAL by default.

If the information assets are proactively managed across the whole investment lifecycle, this will help organisations to more effectively achieve their organisational objectives.Information asset management solutions should ensure information assets remain genuine, accurate, complete, findable, useable and secure from unauthorised access, alteration and deletion while adhering to relevant legislation. Principles for well-managed information assets can be found in the National Archives of Australia’s (NAA’s)&nbsp;Information management standard for the Australian Government.Entities should also adhere to ethical principles, with transparency, accountability and consent at the forefront of data collection. Individuals or the community should be informed about what data is being collected and for what purpose, and how it will be used. Additionally, entities may be required to gain explicit consent from individuals before collecting sensitive data.Applicability of this standardThese statements detail how entities can meet this standard and comply with the Information asset management policy.Share and collaborateAlign to data ontologiesWhere possible, entities should align to the WofG&nbsp;data.gov.au dataset ontology. This ontology is designed to describe the characteristics of datasets published on data.gov.au. Entities may also consider other portfolio or sector-specific data ontologies. This promotes data accuracy, reduces redundancy and streamlines decision making processes.&nbsp;Classification creates a standardised approach or ‘common language’ for naming, organising, retrieving and sharing content. This helps linking content to a business context and informs decisions regarding disposal, retention, access and security. This uniformity enhances accuracy and ease of retrieval and ensures consistency, supporting freedom of information and change management processes across agencies.&nbsp;Tools like business classification schemes, records classification tools, classification by function, functions thesaurus, and records authorities help develop an agency’s classification&nbsp;Align to metadata standardsTo meet requirements of the Office of the National Data Commissioner (ONDC) to enable data sharing and the NAA’s requirements for effective management of information assets over time, entities should refer to the:Australian Government recordkeeping metadata standard – designed to help entities meet business, accountability and archival requirements in a systematic and consistent way by maintaining reliable, meaningful and accessible recordsONDC metadata attributes guide – developed to aid entities that are considering data inventory uplift work.Alignment with common WofG metadata standards is a crucial part of effective information asset management. Alignment facilitates interoperability and enhances information asset integration and sharing across entities. Comprehensive metadata must accompany public datasets, retaining information on data sources, methodologies and any limitations to facilitate accurate interpretation and application.Create inventories and cataloguesThe NAA recommends entities design and maintain an&nbsp;information asset register&nbsp;to enable entity-wide understanding of records, information and data.The&nbsp;Australian Government data catalogue&nbsp;is hosted on Dataplace and it is a searchable online index developed by the ONDC to help users discover, request and access data held by Australian Government agencies. The catalogue draws on open and restricted data to facilitate the use of public sector data for innovation, research and improved government services. The catalogue contains metadata but does not host the actual data, rather it directs users to the relevant data custodians for access.Implement appropriate information asset governance and risk frameworksInformation asset governance is a system for managing information assets across an entity. Entities should develop an ongoing information asset governance system, as well as appoint a chief information governance officer. The&nbsp;Foundational Four&nbsp;provides entities with guidance on establishing an ongoing data governance program.Share as open by defaultThe&nbsp;Australian Government’s&nbsp;public data policy resources&nbsp;require all Commonwealth entities to make non-sensitive data open by default. At a minimum, entities will publish appropriately anonymised government data by default:on or linked through&nbsp;data.gov.au&nbsp;for discoverability and availabilityin a machine-readable, spatially enabled formatwith high quality, easy to use and freely available API access (API content&nbsp;on the Australian Government Architecture provides information on how data should be shared securely) with descriptive metadata which adhere to the metadata standardsusing agreed open standardskept up to date in an automated wayunder a Creative Commons by attribution licence unless a clear case is made to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet for another open licence.Share with states and territoriesIn addition to the open by default requirements, the&nbsp;Intergovernmental Agreement on data sharing between Commonwealth and State and Territory governments&nbsp;(IGA) requires that public sector data be shared as a default position between states, territories and the Commonwealth where it can be done securely, safely, lawfully and ethically. Data shared under the IGA must be in accordance with established privacy and security standards and policies, including complaints handling processes.Share on DataplaceDataplace&nbsp;is a WofG platform maintained by the ONDC on which to request Australian Government data, including under the DATA Scheme. The platform brings together those wanting to get access to Australian Government data (such as researchers and those working on public policy and delivering public services) with Commonwealth entities who are the data custodians.Collaborate with the private and research sectorsEntities should explore opportunities to facilitate public-private partnerships and public research partnerships to jointly address challenges and opportunities, leveraging the expertise of both external sectors to derive innovative solutions that benefit the public. The private sector and researchers could be encouraged to develop applications, tools or insights that use public data, which fosters innovation.Entities should also explore opportunities to provide training programs and capacity building initiatives to enhance the skills of private and research sector professionals working with public data, fostering a more robust ecosystem.Collaborate with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peopleEntities should partner with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people at all stages of the data lifecycle to ensure their priorities are reflected in data about their communities. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leadership is crucial for improving the relevance, accessibility, interpretability and timeliness of Indigenous data in the APS.&nbsp;The&nbsp;Framework for the Governance of Indigenous Data&nbsp;aims to improve the accessibility, relevance, interpretability and timeliness of government held data for Aboriginal Torres Strait Islander people. Non-corporate Commonwealth entities are required to prepare implementation plans responding to the actions contained within the framework together with a timeframe for implementation.Appropriately create, manage, retain and dispose information assetsEach entity will have business systems that create, keep and manage information assets, including data and datasets. Data and datasets retained in business systems, like other information created and received in connection with Australian government business, are Commonwealth records and must be managed in accordance with the&nbsp;Archives Act 1983.The NAA’s current WofG policy&nbsp;Building Trust in the Public Record: Managing information and data for government and community&nbsp;outlines implementation actions to achieve the policy outcomes of strategic information asset governance, fit for purpose information management processes, practices and systems, and the reduction of information management inefficiency and risk.&nbsp;Retain and disposeEntities must manage information assets in accordance with their minimum retention period. These periods are usually set by the NAA though legal instruments known as&nbsp;records authorities. Disposal may involve arranging secure destruction of the information assets (including data and datasets) or, where applicable, transferring custody or ownership of the information assets to another entity through machinery of government changes.&nbsp;More information can be found here Retaining, managing and disposing of data and datasets.Transparent, responsible and secure handling of information assets is essential. The NAA provides further guidance to entities on&nbsp;outsourcing&nbsp;digital storage options, including data centre, digital repository and cloud computing. A key policy to protecting Australian Government systems and the data they hold is the Hosting Certification Framework. It operationalises the principles outlined in the&nbsp;Whole-of-Government Hosting Strategy, in particular the requirement that all data must be hosted with the appropriate level of privacy, sovereignty and security controls.Datasets of enduring value should be labelled ‘Retain as National Archives’ (RNA) in relevant records authorities. These are typically of permanent value, meaning they have historical, cultural or evidential importance and must be preserved. These should be transferred into the care of the NAA. In some instances, particularly for large datasets with continuing business use, the NAA may enter an agreed distributed custody arrangement, where an entity will continue to manage the dataset that has been identified as part of the archival resources of the Australian Government.&nbsp;Specify and maintain stringent information asset control conditionsMost Commonwealth entities are subject to mandatory requirements detailed in the&nbsp;Australian Government Protective Security Policy Framework.There are three core protective security policies that together safeguard government information assets from unauthorised access or harm:Personnel security&nbsp;– ensuring that access to information is provided on a strict need to know basis only to people who have been assessed as suitable.Physical security&nbsp;– preventing unauthorised access or harm to government resources, including information assets, through physical control measures such as entry barriers and security systems.Information and communication technology security&nbsp;– having in place operational procedures and technical control measures to manage access, transmission, storage and disposal of information.Plan for digital preservationEnsure that consideration is given to retention periods that may be longer than the life of the system that data are captured in. Preserving information assets may require migration to new platforms and formats. Regular and planned migration helps avoid obsolescence and ensures information continues to be accessible and usable.&nbsp;The NAA provides further information about&nbsp;digital preservation planning.Align operational and technological needsWhen adopting an information asset management solution, entities should ensure alignment with operational needs. It is important that the solution has sufficient functionality to manage information assets appropriately.&nbsp;The NAA’s&nbsp;Business System Assessment Framework&nbsp;provides Commonwealth entities with a consistent, streamlined, risk-based approach to the assessment of information management functionality in business systems and compliance with metadata standards. It is consistent with Part 1 of International Standard&nbsp;ISO16175, which provides internationally agreed functional requirements and associated guidance for applications that manage digital records.Information asset management requirements should be considered for office productivity software such as&nbsp;Microsoft 365&nbsp;as well as for&nbsp;current, emerging and critical technologies.&nbsp;Ensure that data is easy to exchange and share for business efficiency and accountabilityData interoperability enables the exchanging of data between different systems and organisations. The&nbsp;Data Interoperability Maturity Model&nbsp;(DIMM) provides a way to assess an entity’s progress towards data interoperability.The decision between certain technological solutions (e.g. a SQL database, data lake, data warehouse, etc.) may be significant, especially when handling larger pools of complex data. When choosing how to house their data, entities should consider:the format of the data (structured, unstructured or semi-structured)the value and purpose of the datadata processing requirementsdata storage and budget constraintswho is using the datatechnology and data ecosystems.More information on data interoperability can be found in the&nbsp;Integration&nbsp;domain.Engage earlyEntities must ensure early engagement with the DTA where proposals for information asset management systems either:identify that system development will be part of future budget roundsindicate the intention to undertake an investigation which may require an asset management system in the future.These should be sourced from a collaboration between information, records and data teams and ICT areas. The NAA, through its&nbsp;Agency Service Centre, may also be of assistance.Adhere to reuse principlesEntities must adhere to the reuse principles.Before an entity procures a system or reviews existing systems, it should consider its use-case-specific information asset requirements, including volume and nature of data, information and records, broader system purpose, performance matters, and privacy/sensitivity concerns.&nbsp;Depending on needs, entities should consider platforms that implement mechanisms for both real-time and batch data integration, allowing the platform to accommodate different data collection frequencies based on the nature of the information. The entity should enforce stringent data quality checks during the collection process to identify and rectify inaccuracies or inconsistencies at the source. Finally, standardised data formats and protocols should be used to facilitate seamless integration and ensure uniformity in the collected data.The Australian Government Architecture provides information for entities on reuse.Comply with legislationEntities must comply with the following regulations:The&nbsp;Archives Act 1983&nbsp;(Cth),&nbsp;enables the NAA to determine record-keeping standards and provide related advice to Commonwealth entities, and imposes record keeping obligations in respect of Commonwealth records. Digital information assets used in government business are Commonwealth records to be managed in accordance with the&nbsp;Archives Act 1983&nbsp;(Cth).The&nbsp;Data Availability and Transparency&nbsp;(DAT)&nbsp;Act 2022&nbsp;(Cth) is intended to improve public sector data accessibility, facilitate its consistent sharing with privacy safeguards, enhance integrity and transparency, instil confidence in its use, and establish institutional sharing arrangements.The&nbsp;Freedom of Information Act 1982&nbsp;(Cth) gives the Australian public the right to access documents held by Australian Government agencies and ministers, unless an exemption applies, as well as rights pertaining to documents under the FOI Act that contain information about an individual or their business.The&nbsp;Privacy Act&nbsp;1988&nbsp;(Cth) is intended to promote and protect the privacy of individuals and to regulate how Australian Government agencies and organisations with an annual turnover of more than $3 million, and some other organisations, handle personal information.There are other key pieces of legislation that may also apply depending on the operating context of an entity and information set. Each entity should review relevant federal, state, and local requirements to ensure full compliance."},{"id":"113","title":"Information asset management","excerpt":"The information asset management policy provides whole-of-government guidance for the classification, storage, access and disposal of government information assets.&nbsp; The aims of this policy are to: promote consistency and best practiceenhance security and privacyenable use and re-use of information resources…","description":"","url":"/capability/information-asset-management/policy/","domain":"","type":"AGA Policy","content":"The information asset management policy provides whole-of-government guidance for the classification, storage, access and disposal of government information assets.&nbsp;The aims of this policy are to:promote consistency and best practiceenhance security and privacyenable use and re-use of information resources by government and community to achieve government outcomes, drive innovation, increase economic productivity, and enhance social and cultural outcomesreduce implementation risk of digital and ICT solutions through the reuse of proven designs within governmentensure that new information asset management digital and ICT solutions draw efficiency from preceding investments, implementations, and learnings.Applicability&nbsp;Digital investment proposals are assessed against this policy by the DTA through the&nbsp;Digital and ICT Investment Oversight Framework (IOF).Commonwealth entities are encouraged to apply this policy to all digital investments.Policy requirementsAppropriately create, manage, retain, and dispose information assetsImplement appropriate creation, management, retention, archiving, and destruction practices.

Specific use cases can be broadly categorised into the following archetypes:Stakeholder and service provider payments: Disbursement of financial benefits or entitlements directly to individuals, businesses, organisations, or authorised representatives.Rebate payments to service providers: Payments made to service providers who offer government approved or subsidised services to eligible individuals, businesses, organisations or authorised representatives.Vendor payments: Payments made to vendors and suppliers providing goods and services to government entities. This archetype is typically included within an ERP solutions – see ERP finance standard.Refunds: Issuance of refunds to individuals or businesses who have overpaid monies to an entity.Commercial fee payments:&nbsp;Collection of payments related to duties, fees, or similar.Public donations and contributions:&nbsp;Collection of donations or voluntary contributions from individuals or businesses to fund specific government initiatives or causes.&nbsp;Fund collection/distribution systems: An entity collects funds from one party and redistributes them to another, acting as an intermediary.&nbsp;Fund collections: An entity collects funds from an individual, business or other organisation in accordance with legislation.Prioritise standardisation and interoperabilityEntities should:ensure that payment systems can integrate to an external financial institutes and other third-party payment processorsregularly test interoperability to ensure that updates or changes in one system do not disrupt payment processes.Ensure security and fraud preventionEntities should:use secure networks and data carriersencrypt data both in transit and at restimplement role-based access controls within the payments systems, and any upstream systems, ensuring that only authorised personnel have access to sensitive payment information (refer to Permissions for further detail)implement continuous monitoring systems to detect and prevent fraudulent activity pre-payment and in real timeimplement and maintain robust verification procedures to ensure accurate collection, storage and validation of bank account details before processing any payments, ensuring funds are directed to the correct recipient.Set payment timelines and prompt payment standardsEntities should:set clear timelines for processing payments to both promote prompt payment by individuals and businesses, and give recipients confidence in their timely receipt of fundsif relevant, ensure the ability to expediate and prioritise emergency payments, enabling rapid response in critical situations such as natural disasters.Ensure, and report on, transparency and reportingEntities should:utilise real-time reporting and monitoring capabilities to provide transparent and up-to-date information on payment processes, including status tracking for all stakeholdersleverage the payment platforms centralised data architecture to ensure consistency and accuracy in financial reporting across all entitiesset defined metrics for transparency, and regularly review and report against these.Engage stakeholders and consider user experienceEntities should:enable users to manage their payment options in a simple and accessible manner in line with guidance on Digital Portalsconsider automating dispute resolution workflows to ensure timely resolution of payment disputes.Prioritise simplicity, sustainability, scalability, and emerging trendsEntities must:prepare to transition away from the Bulk Electronic Clearing System framework, expected to close in 2030, in line with the Strategic Plan for Australia’s Payments System.Entities should:consider the integration of the New Payment Platform into existing payment systems to enable real-time processingmaintain interoperability with other payment systems and platforms to ensure seamless integration with emerging technologiesformulate a strategic roadmap for reducing cheque usage, prioritizing a phased migration to digital payment methodsfocus on electronic payments to reduce paper use, aligning payment methods with environmental sustainability goalsensure that any payment-related investment is scalable, accommodating future growth and technological innovations whilst enabling advanced analytics to support&nbsp;shift processes and users to digital payments while ensuring minimal disruption, tailoring the approach to meet the needs of different user groupsoffer a range of digital payment options, allowing users to choose methods that are convenient and accessible to themregularly elevate and update their payment platforms to integrate new technologiesensure payment systems incorporate or enable integration of advanced analytics to support ongoing operational needs.Adhere to reuse principles&nbsp;The Australian Government Architecture provides information for entities on reuse.Entities should:compare their requirements with those of other comparable entities and system functions, and seek to reuse learnings from preceding implementationsconsider specific functional and non-functional requirements prior to solution design or consideration of technology choice, including:volume and nature of payment activitiesbroader entity purposeperformance and availability requirementsprivacy/sensitivity concernsmeet the requirements of the whole-of-government reuse policy."},{"id":"135","title":"Payments","excerpt":"This policy describes the requirements for entities planning digital investments involving payments.

Unique business needs and governance requirements will dictate solution selection, design and implementation.The considerations outlined in this standard are intended to ensure suitable and effective permission implementations across government, assisting entities with reuse of existing investment and developing repeatable patterns.Confirm permissions applicabilityEntities should use the following recommended criteria to confirm the applicability and classification of a permissions solution:&nbsp;Does the permission allow the assessed entity to be something, do something or have something?Is an eligibility assessment conducted, and does a specific set of eligibility conditions have to be met?Has the outcome of the eligibility assessment been captured, and the assessed entity advised of the outcome?Examples of outcomes that meet the above criteria include:sharing data or consenting to usage authorising someone to act on behalf of another person or entity (e.g. power of attorney, nominee)providing a permit to a resident to do something (e.g. at their property or business).Other applicable examples will depend on the business function of each entity. Note that some permissions may lead to an entitlement being provided. The scope and granting of entitlements are covered in the&nbsp;Entitlements&nbsp;capability in the Australian Government Architecture.Comply with legislationEntities must:comply with relevant whole-of-government laws, regulations and domain standards including:Archives Act 1983&nbsp;(Cth)Data Availability and Transparency (DAT) Act 2002&nbsp;(Cth)Freedom of Information Act 1982&nbsp;(Cth)Privacy Act 1988&nbsp;(Cth) comply with any other legislation applicable to specific functions and circumstances.Identify permissions-related rolesEntities should:define a model for permissions that suits their needsalign (and maintain) a mapping of roles in their context to this modeluse this model to shape decisions on solution design and ongoing use.The W3C&nbsp;Verifiable Credentials Data Model v1.1 (w3.org)&nbsp;introduces several key roles, and can be useful when considering an entity’s permissions structure. Each role is defined by its specific steps and functions in the end-to-end permissions process. The following roles are introduced in the specification:Holder&nbsp;– A role an entity might perform by possessing one or more verifiable credentials and generating verifiable presentations from them. Examples include students, employees and customers.Issuer&nbsp;– An entity that makes claims about one or more subjects, creates a verifiable credential from these claims and transmits the verifiable credential to a holder. Examples include corporations, non-profit organisations, trade associations, governments and individuals.Subject&nbsp;– An entity about which claims are made. Examples include human beings, animals and things. In many cases the holder of a verifiable credential is the subject, but not in all. For example, a parent (the holder) might hold the verifiable credentials of a child (the subject), or a pet owner (the holder) might hold the verifiable credentials of their pet (the subject).Verifier&nbsp;– The entity receiving one or more verifiable credentials, optionally inside a verifiable presentation, for processing. Examples include employers, security personnel and websites.Verifiable data registry&nbsp;– A system that mediates the creation and verification of identifiers, keys and other relevant data, such as verifiable credential schemas, revocation registries, issuer public keys and so on, which might be required to use verifiable credentials. Some configurations might require correlating identifiers for subjects. Examples include trusted databases, decentralised databases, government ID databases and distributed ledgers. Often there is more than one type of verifiable data registry utilised in a permissions ecosystem.Identify permissions decision typePermissions solutions can be used within entities to assist decision-making. Typically, entity decision-making may be broadly classified into:Immediate decisions&nbsp;based on the provision of evidence or specific guardrails being met. These permissions generally allow the applicant to proceed with their application as a right, whether it is framed as an ad hoc permission or part of their ongoing eligibility.Future decisions&nbsp;based on assumptions about future need. These decisions are predictive, and subject to future review and confirmation. For example, ‘life events’, where an entity predicts that an individual may need a service or services in the future.Entities should:recognise and identify against decision types during the design stage of permissions solution developmentidentify business and technology systems to suit decision types within the entity’s operational requirements.Align operational and technological needsWhile a range of functional requirements can be captured and considered, end user permission systems typically align to a supplier-specific solution. Options will vary, however there are a range of vendor-agnostic system functions that should be considered and incorporated if appropriate, e.g. zero-trust architecture.Entities must:ensure permissions solutions appropriately log and attribute all permissions decisions, including the denying, granting and revoking of permissions in line with auditability requirementsmeet privacy requirements of individuals, organisations, processes and intellectual propertymeet security needs, particularly if the system contains sensitive or personally identifying data or is otherwise likely a target for threat actors.Entities should:design permission solutions to integrate seamlessly with an entity’s existing infrastructureensure permissions systems enable seamless management as well as robust permission handlingconsider business requirements of the entity for the granting of permission, which may include client servicing, compliance or regulatory oversightconsider technology functionality needed to ensure rules-based assessment, end-to-end workflow management or outcome-based information capture and notificationconsider services wrapper needed to maintain the proposed solution, especially in areas such as records management and storage, change management and business continuity.Apply a risk-based approachEntities should ensure that:permission systems do not inadvertently impact the performance, availability, accessibility or other aspects of systems to the detriment of the user experiencepermission mechanisms do not inadvertently make digital records inaccessible in the long termpermissions are suitably applied to production and non-production environments, to ensure appropriate quality assurance of permission handling and protect information contained in those systems.There are also specific non-functional needs that require upfront consideration, for legislative or practical reasons. Any system proposal that does not meet these needs would immediately be deemed unfit for implementation and ruled out of consideration. These needs may include:auditability requirements of process compliance and determination outcomesprivacy requirements of individuals, organisations, processes and intellectual propertysecurity needs, particularly if the system contains sensitive or personally identifying data or is otherwise likely a target for threat actors.Lower development and maintenance complexity of permissions solutionsEntities are encouraged to work with potential suppliers during design and implementation phases to:minimise the development effort and pathway required, including proof of concept and solution pilots, and de-risk final solution implementationalign with and adopt vendor and industry best practice when developing, deploying and applying permissions solutions, particularly incorporating lessons learned from other government entity implementationsadopt streamlined maintenance models where the value may reduce overall cost and decrease ongoing management effort without adding additional risk.Ensure the ongoing viability of permissions solutionsThe variety of permissions requirements across government makes it difficult to find a single, centralised solution or a universally applicable pattern. Unique permissions needs will dictate solution selection, design and implementation.Entities should:ensure that their selected solution is supportable, affordable, secure and fit-for-purposecheck contractual arrangements, Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) currency and AGA design state in advance of procuring capabilitymaintain their solution to ensure ongoing value and reduce the creation of technical debt.Adhere to reuse principlesReuse&nbsp;content on the Australian Government Architecture provides information for entities on reuse.Entities should:consider permissions-specific functional and non-functional requirements prior to solution design or consideration of technology choice, including:nature of permissionsuser needsbroader system purposeperformance and availability requirementsprivacy and sensitivity concernsmeet the requirements of the whole-of-government reuse policy."},{"id":"140","title":"Personalisation (business)","excerpt":"Explore Personalisation (business) resources\n","description":"Personalisation refers to the managing of tailored experiences for businesses based on their credentials, preferences and needs.","url":"/capability/personalisation-business/","domain":"Business experience","type":"Capability","content":"Explore Personalisation (business) resourcesPolicies and instruments { Reuse cat 1 }_ list{ Reuse cat 2 } list 2View more resourcesConnect with peersConnect with practitioners and experts across the Australian Public Service to share experience and ask questions.

Sitting within this portfolio are the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO), which has a focus on developing quantum for research purposes, and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) which is investigating the commercialisation of quantum research opportunities.DISR in conjunction with the Office of the Chief Scientist were also responsible for shaping and releasing the National Quantum Strategy which was designed to strengthen Australia’s research position while promoting opportunities for commercialisation.The Department of Defence has a special interest in quantum sensing and the use cryptography. Defence’s Next Generations Technology Fund was launched in 2018 to support the development of insights into quantum technologies, with a specific focus on defence related application.Leverage quantum opportunities for governmentEntities investing in quantum should consider the ways in which their investment will fit into the Commonwealth’s enabling of a range of opportunities including:Enabling research: Through Australian Research Council grants and the utilisation of ANSTO and the CSIRO the Commonwealth can bolster the effort going into basic research. This opportunity will allow the government to potentially recoup investment in new research for business and service enablement.Realising economic benefits: Based on a history of quantum innovation there are promising signs for a self-sufficient ecosystem of quantum businesses in Australia. If the government can invest in skills development and the access to emerging quantum technology the conditions favour new business development.Prioritising cybersecurity: Quantum computing is both a threat and a mitigant to securing data stores and data flow. Quantum cryptography has the potential to secure both data areas. Future Commonwealth regulation is recommended to ensure upgraded security capability, as well as advancing the ability to secure its own systems and information flows.Supporting global collaboration: Australia does not yet have the capabilities to scale research into innovation by itself. By capitalising on significant international engagement Government entities can leverage international relationships to build links between researchers.Recognise the forecast timeframe for the development of quantum related technology solutionsQuantum technologies are developing rapidly, and while the full functionality of quantum computing is still emerging, others are already in everyday use.Entities should:be aware that different technologies will mature and be ready for commercial applications at different times over the next 10 years, and beyondalign to the National Quantum Strategy, which forecasts the evolution of a range of quantum specific functions over the next 20+ years.Ensure the sustainability of quantum computing solutionsAs an emerging technology, there is critical obligation on entities to take a forward-minded view to investment.Entities should:develop an internal quantum strategy and policy prior, or equivalent, to set clear direction in advance of any other worksensure that their selected solution is supportable, affordable, secure, and fit-for-purposecomprehensively document any work in quantum computing, and make this documentation available to other entitiescontinuously review outcomes against strategic direction, assessing against outcomes and costs, and change direction proactively rather than reflexively.Adhere to reuse principlesThe Australian Government Architecture provides information for entities on Reuse.Entities should:compare their requirements with those of other comparable entities and system functions, and seek to reuse learnings from preceding implementationsconsider specific functional and non-functional requirements prior to solution design or consideration of technology choice, including:auditability requirements of use cases, processes and/or outcomesprivacy requirements of individuals, organisations, processes, or intellectual propertysecurity needs, particularly if the system contains sensitive or personally identifying data or is otherwise likely a target for threat actorsavailability/redundancy, especially in the case of systems supporting round-the-clock needs such as medical or emergency service activitiesmeet the requirements of the Digital and ICT Reuse Policy."},{"id":"154","title":"Quantum Computing","excerpt":"This policy describes the requirements for entities planning digital investments involving quantum computing.

In government context, reuse enables simple, consistent, and accelerated government services through standardisation and utilisation of these common components. This can be enabled via partial or full utilisation of existing solutions, or by onboarding to an existing service in place of standing up a new platform.In the Australian Government context, the term 'reuse' means using an existing component within the process of realising a new digital or ICT solution, as grouped into the following categories:Technology and architecturePlatforms and servicesArchitecture frameworks, standards, and patternsCommon components and codeBusiness capability and processBusiness capability models and process designsGovernance modelsBusiness requirements and rulesProcurementCommercial, legal, and licensing agreementsWhole-of-government (WofG) procurement resourcesProcurement processesInformation and dataUser and customer researchData setsSkills and capabilitiesDigital and ICT skills and capabilitiesReuse enables simple, consistent, and accelerated government services through standardisation and utilisation of these components. This can be enabled via partial or full utilisation of existing solutions, or by onboarding to an existing Shared Services Arrangement in place of standing up a new platform.Reuse should not stand in the way of competitiveness, innovation, and adoption of modern solutions. Any new adoption of new technologies or standards, or development of new components, should enable future reuse while retaining compatibility with other related governmental policy and advice.The Digital and ICT Reuse Standard applies to Non-corporate Commonwealth entities subject to the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013.For corporate Commonwealth entities and wholly owned Commonwealth companies, the standard represents better practice.Reuse guidanceThe Digital and ICT Reuse Policy is underpinned by several themes: engagement, governance, architecture, and operations. As a starting point, entities should:identify their use case requirements and alignment to business capabilitiesstart engagement with key stakeholders and entities that may harbour reusable components early in planning of proposals to identify reuseable capabilities or what is required to be built for reuseestablish governance arrangements, including high-level architectures mapping to broadly applicable base capabilities, to ensure objectives are achieved and standards are adhered to throughout the delivery processif building whole-of-government (WofG) capabilities, establish and maintain the WofG base capability as well as the necessary support processes, tools, and guidance to facilitate reuse or onboarding by consuming entitiesunderstand factors effecting reuse such as commonality of the use case requirements, existing technology and data environment, scale, and the availability of the reusable content.Understand use case requirementsMany different solutions and platforms are available in government. There is therefore significant opportunity to derive value from previous investment.&nbsp;Entities should:understand specific functional and non-functional use case requirementsunderstand how their own systems requirements can be aligned to existing systems.Use case requirements of specific note may include:alignment to defined business capabilitiesscale/volume/frequency/availabilitytactical/strategic nature of solution&nbsp;security/privacypolicy mandatesexisting technological landscapeuser and client needs/attributesnature of data contained/managed.Architecturally map alignment to business capabilitiesAny technological solution/system can be considered through the lens of the capabilities it enables. The Open Group define a capability as 'an ability to do something'. A business capability, then, represents the ability for a business to do something.Entities should:map the proposal to the business capabilities it enables, aligning it to policies, standards, and designs (representing previous investment that can be leveraged)adopt an overarching Enterprise Architecture approach that aligns its function and structure to business capabilities, and further to technical solutions and patterns.&nbsp;Consider scale of solution and appropriate licencing/hostingICT applications and solutions commonly used across government, including in the domains of Customer Relationship Management, Case Management, Enterprise Resource Planning, Grant Management, and many others, may be considered in terms of scale (micro/mid/enterprise), and supply/licencing/hosting.Entities should:&nbsp;gain a good understanding of scale, supply, licencing, and hosting related requirements and options available as aligned to vendor offerings:Micro-scale COTS.Locally installed on organisation computers, often with simple extensions to support specific organisational needs and integrations, and generally only supporting standardised, simple solutions and processes.Micro-scale SaaS.Subscription-based and hosted on a hosting provider’s servers. Mostly used by multiple organisations in the same shared technology platform, with limited capacity for custom configurations, deployment, or hosting.Mid-scale SaaS.Similar to Micro-scale SaaS, but with a higher level of organisational configuration and customisation than micro-scale. Allow extension to handle more complex models/transactions/processes, but generally only with a small number of variations and in a simple structure or deployment context.Enterprise-scale SaaSSpecific to the organisation (or organisations) they are servicing and often referred to as a “private cloud offering”. A vendor provides the software and technology layer, with contractual responsibility for design, implementation, maintenance, and support. Very high enrolment, and implementation(s) should support high-volume, low-cost unit rates or high-cost specialist transactions, and support multiple customisation and localisation options beyond the vendor’s base offering, as well as allowing for significant scaling and expansion.Subscription-based PaaSA cloud offering that broadens the SaaS model to include the vendor delivering infrastructure for hosting software, data, and other requisite components within the service.Government Platform as a Service (GPaaS)A combination model where government acts as the platform provider and controls the design, implementation, maintenance, and support of combined services. In this model, government may make use of specific SaaS services from enterprise-scale providers, and/or utilise Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), or on-premises (own infrastructure) to deliver a solution. Distinct in that government determines and owns the implementation, the frequency of maintenance and support, and other functionality or lifecycle management. This is a strictly private-to-government arrangement, in which implementation(s) must support high-cost, specialist transactions and may support high-volume, low-cost unit rates.select a solution and arrangement aligned to the needs of the system and organisation.Consider whether a solution is tactical or strategicEntities should:&nbsp;understand whether solutions can be considered as:Strategic:&nbsp;A solution developed to solve a business need in a manner that is ongoing and will receive medium to long-term support.Tactical: A fast-tracked solution designed to solve an urgent need, often delivered with less procedural rigour and in a manner that does not suit a long-term implementation.reuse tactical solutions only for other tactical purposes, and only where components of the existing solution are suitable for re-implementation with minimal reworkreuse strategic solutions for strategic or tactical purposes where suitablemaintain appropriate documentation highlighting the nature of reuse and plans for managing any incurred technical debt.Reuse whenever possibleEntities should:&nbsp;investigate options to plan for and make use of opportunities for reuse.

The consideration of reuse as a requirement when investing in, and maintaining, digital and ICT delivery will help drive lower build and run costs, increase speed and certainty of delivery, and enable interconnectivity of services for people and businesses.Entities should:&nbsp;document and archive patterns and other key system details in an accessible and navigable internal repositorystandardise data formats and interoperability protocolsalign architecture to industry standard frameworks such as The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF)adhere to industry standards such as Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)adhere to applicable governmental guidelines and non-functional requirements, including those presented on the AGA&nbsp;maintain awareness of best practice for relevant technologies at all levels including technology selection and hosting, data management, software development/quality assurance/deployment, etc.consider how a system may be appropriately modularised to enable repurposing/reuse with minimal rework/risk to the initial systemmaintain high quality technical documentation throughout works, that can be provided for future reusedevelop the necessary support processes, tools, and guidance to facilitate reuse or onboarding by other entities.Minimise Technical DebtTechnical debt is defined as accrued work that is ’owed’ to an IT system, a side effect of software engineering resulting from teams ’borrowing’ against quality by making sacrifices, taking short cuts, or using workarounds to meet delivery deadlines.Entities should:&nbsp;consider technical debt when implementing a solution intended to be reusableconsider any instances of reuse as opportunities to remediate previously incurred debtunderstand the long-term cost of technical debt and budget for future remediations/long term costs associated with short-term solutionsensure new technical debt is taken on in a deliberate manner and tracked/planned for, according to the situational needs and in line with a long-term strategyconsider debt management as an ongoing process throughout the delivery lifecycle(s) and analyse and document appropriatelyestablish and maintain the WofG base capability as well as the necessary support processes, tools, and guidance to facilitate reuse or onboarding by consuming entities for WofG capabilities.&nbsp;Enable reuse by othersEntities should ensure anything created is available to those who might derive benefit from it (unless there are legislative/ethical barriers).

Buyers are informed that:early consideration of the digital investment factors helps them get the outcome they needthey should consider these factors during the strategic planning of their investment outcome.The digital investments factors include:Be user-centred, by involving users from the start of an investment, through to operation and management. Prioritise usability by ensuring the solution is developed to be easy to use.Seek advice from technology, industry and procurement experts who might help to challenge traditional practices and explore new possibilities. Also consider how investments fit into the existing agency and technology environments.Consider the whole-of-life cost of investments, not just the initial purchase price.Align with whole-of-government requirements, including but not limited to:AccessibilitySecurity and PrivacyAustralian Government ArchitectureDigital and ICT ReuseFor more information on the digital investment factors see&nbsp;Appendix A.How can I&nbsp;implement this standard?Recraft your procurement process by introducing a stage covering planning considerations prior to drafting procurement requirements. See the&nbsp;Digital Sourcing Lifecycle&nbsp;for more information on what a plan stage should include.Ensure buyers are aware the procurement process starts a lot earlier than they may think. Remind buyers the decisions they make prior to starting a procurement strongly influence their investment outcome.Make delegates aware that buyers should consider and incorporate the digital investment factors prior to seeking approval.Provide guidance so that buyers can understand how each factor applies to them. This can be done by linking to the DTA's&nbsp;guidance&nbsp;or by using the guidance content in internal documentation.Stage: Drafting requirementsRequirements are designed to allow for a range of solutions to deliver business outcomes.What is the standard?Use outcomes focused requirements:&nbsp;Outcomes focused requirements are the default and preferred option, leaving sufficient room for the market to propose solutions.The limited circumstances where technical solutions could be specified are clearly outlined (such as low value, low risk commodity purchases).There is a regular review of the limited circumstance against market offerings, which re-validates the case for each limited circumstance.Creating smaller work packages, where possible, is promoted, helping to ensure businesses of all sizes can offer solutions to government.At a minimum, buyers set up their contracts to follow the&nbsp;Digital Sourcing Contract Limits and Reviews Policy.Make access easy for businesses of all sizes:Buyers provide clear, high-quality information up front to sellers. This includes minimising government jargon and ensuring information is easy to understand for a range of sellers.Buyers cannot specify that having worked with government is a condition of getting work and are discouraged from classifying work with a higher security classification than is required.How can I implement this standard?To support a mindset shift towards using outcomes focused requirements, remind buyers this practice means the market can offer useful solutions they may not be aware of.Include prompts or guidance within Request for Quote (RFQ)/Request for Tender (RFT) templates.Embed practices within internal checklists and guidance.Ensure further guidance is available by linking to the DTA's&nbsp;guidance&nbsp;or by using the guidance content in internal documentation.Stage: Approach the marketPanels that offer a better experience for buyers and sellers are considered (if using a panel).What is the standard?Buyers are encouraged to evaluate against the&nbsp;list of&nbsp;digital certified panels&nbsp;if a panel is their chosen sourcing mechanism.How can I implement this standard?Encourage buyers to evaluate against the list of digital certified panels in internal templates and/or guidance about approaching the market.Stage: Evaluation and negotiationEvaluations are set up to be fair to all sellers, enabling buyers to find the best opportunities to meet their needs.What is the standard?Buyers are made aware that the best value for money is not necessarily the tender which offers the lowest price.Buyers do not unfairly advantage or disadvantage any tenderer. All tenderers should be afforded equal opportunity.Buyers ensure there is no bias or favouritism, while declaring and managing any conflicts of interest.Buyers maintain clear and transparent records to inform feedback to sellers.How can I implement this standard?Prompt buyers on how to set up their evaluations to be fair in internal evaluation templates, checklists and/or guidance.Ensure further guidance is available by linking to the DTA's&nbsp;guidance&nbsp;or by using the guidance content in internal documentation.Stage: Buying and contractingProcurement processes are streamlined to minimise burden and attract sellers.What is the standard?Buyers are encouraged to simplify and streamline their procurement. Buyers should:use the minimum number of steps to reach their outcome, reducing processes where possibleclearly communicate their procurement process intentions to the marketconsider the financial impacts of lengthy processes on sellersrequest only necessary information from sellersuse consistent contract templates where applicable (like the&nbsp;Digital Sourcing Contract Template Suite).How can I implement this standard?Encourage buyers to reduce the number of steps used to go to the market. For example, buyers could use an outcomes focused brief instead of a multi-stage Request for Information (RFI)/RFT process. This can combine the Expression of Interest (EOI), RFI, RFQ/RFT stages into one stage.Encourage buyers to use a simpler tender process where possible. This includes encouraging the use of panel arrangements for purchases falling within categories well catered for by panels (e.g. hardware, software, data centres, telecommunications and cloud).Guide buyers to design contracts that focus on the quality of the outcome, with a shared understanding, high-trust partnerships, risk sharing and agreed flexibility in responding to change built in. This can be accomplished by encouraging buyers to:design their approach to market and contract formation stages to focus on what the seller must achieve (the outcomes), rather than how it is achieved (the inputs and outputs).put a greater focus on interactions over processes, responding to change over following a plan and quality of outcomes over number of hours or a set price.Make the procurement process user centred by ensuring that it meets the needs of casual and experienced buyers.Ensure appropriate engagement with risk. This can be done by:having the delegate as close to the decision as possiblenot making internal processes more restrictive than they need to be (e.g. adding additional layers on top of base CPR requirements)not mandating that buyers must obtain 3 quotes for under procurements under $80,000.Minimise procurement processes that require sellers to provide onerous amounts of information that may not be required.Stage: Feedback and managementSellers are provided useful feedback that helps them improve.What is the standard?Buyers provide useful feedback to sellers following a request for debrief. Feedback:must be detailed enough to help businesses improve their offering the next time they pitch to governmentshould be provided against the broad range of areas and criteria considered in the evaluation process.How can I implement this standard?Provide buyers with guidance on how they can provide feedback. For example, they can provide feedback based on:a comparison of the offer to the evaluation criteria (not in comparison to other offers received)the strengths of the offerthe weaknesses of the offerthe suitability and attractiveness of the experience, qualifications, referee reports or past performancean indication of cost competitivenessthe adequacy of the administrative or management systemsany quality management issuesthe nominated personnel, e.g. number, experience, skills, knowledge, and quality of management."},{"id":"163","title":"Technical for government’s use of artificial intelligence","excerpt":"Direct link:&nbsp;www.digital.gov.au/ai-tech-standardResponsible agency: Digital Transformation AgencyLast updated: 30 July 2025 The Technical standard for government’s use of artificial intelligence&nbsp;brings together a set of practices for designing, developing, deploying and using AI systems.

A voluntary scheme, the TDIF set out rules and standards around privacy, security, transparency, trust and choice to be followed by accredited organisations.Based on globally recognised best practices and standards, the TDIF informed the development of the Digital ID Act 2024. &nbsp;ApplicabilityThe TDIF has been superseded by the Australian Government Digital ID System (AGDIS) and a new accreditation scheme established by the Digital ID Act 2024.TDIF Identity Proofing LevelsIdentity Proofing Levels were an accreditation standard within the TDIF.Identity Proofing Level 1Identity Proofing Level 1 (IP1)&nbsp;was used when no identity verification was needed or when a very low level of confidence in the claimed identity was needed. This level supported self-asserted identity (I am who I say I am) or pseudonymous identity.&nbsp;IP1 was for services where the risks of not undertaking identity verification would have a negligible consequence to the individual or the service. For example, to pay a parking infringement or obtain a fishing licence.Identity Proofing Level 1 PlusIdentity Proofing Level 1 Plus (IP1 Plus)&nbsp;was used when a low level of confidence in the claimed identity was needed. This required one identity document to verify a claim to an existing identity.&nbsp;IP1 Plus was for services where the risks of getting identity verification wrong would have minor consequences to the individual or the service. For example, the provision of loyalty cards.Identity Proofing Level 2Identity Proofing Level 2 (IP2) was used when a low-medium level of confidence in the claimed identity was needed. It required two or more identity documents to verify a claim to an existing identity.&nbsp;IP2 was for services where the risks of getting identity verification wrong would have moderate consequences to the individual or the service. For example, the provision of utility services. An Identity Proofing Level 2 Identity check was similar to the traditional “100-point check”.Identity Proofing Level 2 PlusIdentity Proofing Level 2 Plus (IP 2 Plus) was used when a medium level of confidence in the claimed identity was needed. It required two or more identity documents to verify a claim to an existing identity and required the binding objective to be met.&nbsp;IP2 Plus was for services where the risks of getting identity verification wrong would have moderate-high consequences to the individual or the service. For example, undertaking large financial transactions.Identity Proofing Level 3Identity Proofing Level 3 (IP 3) was used when a high level of confidence in the claimed identity was needed. It required two or more identity documents to verify a claim to an existing identity and required the binding objective to be met.&nbsp;IP3 was for services where the risks of getting identity verification wrong would have high consequences to the individual or the service. For example, access to welfare and related government services.Identity Proofing Level 4 (IP 4)Identity Proofing Level 4 (IP 4) was used when a very high level of confidence in the claimed identity was needed. It required four or more identity documents to verify a claim to an existing identity. The individual claiming the identity had to attend an in-person interview and meet the requirements of IP 3.&nbsp;IP 4 was for services where the risks of getting identity verification wrong would have very high consequences to the individual or the service. For example, the issuing of government-issued documents like an Australian passport.TDIF Credential LevelsCredential Levels were an accreditation standard within the TDIF.Credential Level 1Credential Level 1 (CL1) provided a basic authentication credential suitable for use at the IP1 proofing level. This allowed single-factor authentication, e.g. password.Credential Level 2&nbsp;Credential Level 2 (CL2) provided a strong authentication credential suitable at the IP1, IP2 and IP3 proofing levels. This required two-factor authentication, e.g. password with additional one-time password.Credential Level 3Credential Level 3 (CL3) provided a very strong authentication credential, suitable at the IP1, IP2, IP3 and IP4 levels. This required two-factor authentication and hardware verification.Accreditation StandardsAttribution Provider&nbsp;Attribute Provider was an accreditation standard within the TDIF.&nbsp;Attributes are additional information about a person or business such as entitlements or characteristics (for example, that an individual had a particular qualification). Attribute providers generated and managed attributes and claims about an individual, business or organisation that were provided to reliant services.Identity ExchangeThe TDIF Identity Exchange was an accreditation standard within the TDIF. It was an entity that had been accredited in accordance with the TDIF as an identity exchange and that provided a service that conveyed, managed and coordinated the flow of data or other information between participants in an Identity Federation."},{"id":"165","title":"Use the AGA","excerpt":"","description":"","url":"/use/","domain":"","type":"Capability","content":"Plan your digital project Use the guidance within the Australian Government Architecture to support your project planning.
