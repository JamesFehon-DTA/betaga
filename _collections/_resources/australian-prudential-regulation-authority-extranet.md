## Details

Direct link: [*www.apra.gov.au/apra-extranet*](http://www.apra.gov.au/apra-extranet)  
Responsible agency: **Australian Prudential Regulation Authority**  
  
The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) extranet is a secure portal for regulated institutions to report data to APRA. Regulated institutions can use it to:

* access the breach reporting system
* create and track MySuper applications.

It will also be used to report data to APRA outside of the reporting requirements for Direct to APRA (D2A).

To access the APRA Extranet, users for regulated institutions need to have a Digital Identity, such as [myID](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/myid), and link it to a business using [Relationship authorisation manager (RAM)](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/relationship-authorisation-manager).
