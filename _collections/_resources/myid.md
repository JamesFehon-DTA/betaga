myGovID changed its name to myID on 13 November 2024.

myID is a whole-of-government digital identity solution which can be used by Australians to prove who they are online, and provide an identity that can be re-used to access [participating government online services](https://www.myid.gov.au/online-services-you-can-use).

myID is the Australian Government's Digital ID app available through the Australian Government's Digital ID System.

The setup process requires users to:

* be at least 15 years old
* have a personal email address or mobile phone number
* have a smartphone or smart device
* download the myID app
* prepare documents that help prove identity, such as passport, driver’s licence, birth certificate or Medicare card
* choose which [identity strength](https://www.digitalidsystem.gov.au/digital-identity-for-you/what-are-identity-proofing-levels) is required (basic, standard, or strong - depending on the service that is required).

myID is accredited under the [Trusted Digital Identity Framework](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/trusted-digital-identity-framework-tdif-0) as an identity provider (reusable digital identity, mobile application, identity proofing levels 1, 2 and 3, and biometric enabled) and credential provider (mobile application, credential level 2 and multi-factor crypto software).
