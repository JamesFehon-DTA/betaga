The [*Guide to undertaking privacy impact assessments*](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/privacy-guidance-for-organisations-and-government-agencies/privacy-impact-assessments/guide-to-undertaking-privacy-impact-assessments) supports agencies and organisations subject to the Privacy Act 1988, to undertake privacy impact assessments (PIA).

It has been prepared by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC). The PIA Guide is intended to provide guidance to all Australian Privacy Principle (APP) entities.

The guide also has an accompanying [PIA tool](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/privacy-guidance-for-organisations-and-government-agencies/privacy-impact-assessments/privacy-impact-assessment-tool) that assists APP entities to:

* conduct a PIA
* report the PIA findings
* respond to PIA recommendations.
