## Details

Direct link: [*www.sro.vic.gov.au/myGov*](http://www.sro.vic.gov.au/myGov)   
Responsible agency: **State Revenue Office Victoria**

The State Revenue Office Victoria hosts [My Land Tax](https://www.sro.vic.gov.au/my-land-tax), an online application that enables users to manage land tax information and to:

* view, download and pay assessments
* update property ownership information
* apply for land tax exemptions
* track the progress of enquiries
* manage contact details for land tax.

My Land Tax can be linked to a user’s myGov account, so that their land tax assessments can be delivered directly to their myGov inbox rather than through the post.
