Responsible agency: **Australian Public Service Commission**

The APS Digital Profession is an initiative that aims to lift the digital expertise of the Australian Public Sector (APS) and meet the long-term capability needs of government. It is an online community that helps agencies design and deliver better products and services for the needs of the Australian community. The Digital Profession has two goals:

* to grow the membership of digital professionals
* to provide ongoing value to our members and potential members.

To achieve these goals, it provides members access to career development and training, mobility opportunities across government, networking and mentorship, and a platform for the recognition of their skills and expertise. It also provides guides and resources on best practice methodology to design and deliver digital services.

The APS Digital Profession includes an APS Career Pathfinder tool that allows APS employees to upload their skills and explore various digital career paths in the APS.

The initiative aligns with the APS Reform Agenda by building digital capability across the public service, fostering innovation, enhancing service delivery, and ensuring the APS is equipped to meet the evolving needs of Australians in a rapidly changing digital landscape.
