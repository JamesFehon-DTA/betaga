The [Cloud marketplace](https://www.buyict.gov.au/sp?id=marketplace_landing&marketplace=20d4561edb261c106529773c349619b7&kb=KB0010616&path=buying) is a digital sourcing arrangement for cloud computing offerings to government. It is managed by the Digital Transformation Agency.

All federal, state, territory and local government buyers can use the Cloud Marketplace to browse and request quotes on both cloud consulting expertise and cloud services.

The marketplace operates as a cooperative panel arrangement, with sellers appointed through an initial open approach to market and subsequent refreshes.

Entities are encouraged to use the marketplace to procure cloud services as per the [Cloud computing standard](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/cloud-computing-standard).
