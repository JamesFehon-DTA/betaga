Responsible agency: **Australian Signals Directorate**  
  
The [Blueprint for secure cloud](https://blueprint.asd.gov.au/) (previously known as the *Protected utility blueprint*) is an online tool to support the design, configuration and deployment of collaborative and secure cloud and hybrid workspaces, with a current focus on Microsoft 365.

The Blueprint provides better practice guidance, configuration guides and templates covering risk management, architecture and standard operating procedures developed as per the controls in Australian Signals Directorate’s [Information security manual (ISM)](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/information-security-manual-ism).

Entities are also encouraged to use this design for [cloud computing](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/cloud-computing) solutions, as highlighted in the [cloud computing standard](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/cloud-computing-standard).

The Blueprint is primarily developed for government organisations, but private sector organisations may also find it useful.

If you have any questions or suggestions about the Blueprint, or to request targeted technical advice, please contact the [ASD blueprint team](https://blueprint.asd.gov.au/about/).
