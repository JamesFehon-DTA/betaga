GovCMS is a whole-of-government content management system (CMS) and web hosting service. Created by government, for government, GovCMS has all the tools agencies need to create and host their websites and digital services.

GovCMS is built using Drupal, an open-source platform, and hosted on a public cloud. It is designed to help government agencies to publish and update accurate and timely information on their websites without needing a team of in-house developers. The site also enables a project space where developers can manage and configure their agencies’ websites.

GovCMS has two service offerings, depending on an agency’s needs:

* Software as a service (SaaS) – a managed service where agencies create their own website then host it through GovCMS
* Platform as a service (PaaS) – a self-managed service where agencies custom-build more flexible websites but take responsibility for ongoing security updates and patching.

The platform also facilitates access to an approved list of suppliers to support agencies to build or re-design a website through the [Drupal services panel](https://www.govcms.gov.au/dsp).

There are more than 300 government websites for more than 100 government agencies currently hosted on the platform, many of which are listed in the [GovCMS gallery](https://www.govcms.gov.au/gallery).

GovCMS is based on the [Digital service standard](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/digital-service-standard-v2), helping agencies build and deliver websites that are simple, clear and fast for users.
