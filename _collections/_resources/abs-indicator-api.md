Responsible agency: **Australian Bureau of Statistics**  
  
The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) offers a number of data services that allow users to access ABS data and metadata. Some of these services are available through the Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), that enable machine to machine contact and exchange of data.

The ABS Indicator API allows users to request headline economic statistics from the ABS including Australia's key economic indicators. Data is published as soon as the embargo is lifted at 11:30am (Canberra time) on release day.

All datasets are small, containing only the most in-demand data, so responses are returned as fast as possible. If you wish to access full economic datasets via API you can do so using the ABS Data API (Beta).

The ABS Indicator API uses the Statistical Data and Metadata Exchange (SDMX) standard. Data is available in XML, JSON and CSV.

Registration is required to access the Indicator API. More information is available on the [ABS website](https://www.abs.gov.au/about/data-services/application-programming-interfaces-apis/indicator-api).
