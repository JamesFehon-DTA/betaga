Medicare is Australia’s universal health care system and helps Australians with the cost of their health and hospital care. People with a Medicare card need to sign in through myGov to set up and use their Medicare online account, manage claims, update details, or access their digital Medicare card.

Medicare design supports the delivery of the secure, accessible and user-centric digital health services. It aligns with the whole-of-government priorities for identity management, digital inclusion, and service operability.
