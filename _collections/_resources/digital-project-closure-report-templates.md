## Details

​​Use the digital project closure report templates to meet the [Project closure reporting standard for digital and ICT-enabled projects](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/standard/closure-reporting-standard-digital-and-ict-enabled-projects).

The DTA has developed digital project closure report templates in collaboration with the Australian Taxation Office.

The templates and [Closure reporting standard](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/standard/closure-reporting-standard-digital-and-ict-enabled-projects) aim to strengthen project closure reporting practices for digital projects.

Improving these practices is a critical input to efforts by agencies and the DTA to improve digital project performance – including by ensuring future digital projects are informed by lessons identified from closed projects.

If your project is subject to the IOF, ensure you use the right template according to your [project's tier](https://www.digital.gov.au/investment/assurance-framework-digital-ict-investments/assurance-framework-digital-ict-investments-0/sro-requirements-and-tiering-investments).

You can also use the templates for projects not subject to the IOF. Use the template most appropriate for your project.

For Tier 1 or Tier 2 projects, or larger, more complex projects not subject to the IOF use:

* [Digital project closure report template – Tier 1 or 2 project](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/sites/default/files/2025-08/tier_1_and_2_project_closure_report_template_and_guidance.docx)

For Tier 3 projects, or smaller less complex projects not subject to the IOF use:

* [Digital project closure report template – Tier 3 project](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/sites/default/files/2025-08/tier_3_project_closure_report_template_and_guidance.docx)
