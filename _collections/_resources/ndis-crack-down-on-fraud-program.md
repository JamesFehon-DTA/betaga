## Details

Responsible agency: **Department of Social Services**  
  
The *Crack down on fraud* is a program that focusses on strengthening the NDIS systems and improving their processes in order to improve capabilities to detect, prevent, respond to and substantially reduce non-compliant claims and payments within the NDIS. This program supports the larger Fraud Fusion Taskforce program, a joint initiative led by NDIA and Services Australia, that includes 23 more government agencies working on improving fraud prevention and management.

The objectives of the *Crack down on fraud* program are to improve:

* NDIS systems used to assess, process and pay claims, currently managing over 400,000 claims daily
* systems used to check user identities, to increase safety and privacy
* the my NDIS app and NDIS portals.

The outcomes of this program are to build:

* a new ICT system connected with other agencies, providers and banks, to ensure faster and less erroneous processing of claims and payments
* a new fraud investigation system that will connect with other enforcement agencies.
