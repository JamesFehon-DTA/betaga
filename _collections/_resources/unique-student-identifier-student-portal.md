## Details

Responsible agency: **Department of Employment and Workplace Relations**

The Unique student identifier (USI) student portal is used by students to create and manage their USI and log in to their USI account in order to:

* manage their Vocational Education and Training (VET) or higher education enrolment
* seek a VET student loan
* apply for a HELP loan or Commonwealth Supported Place
* manage their graduating requirements.

By linking their USI account to a myGov account, students can easily manage their USI-related activities in the secure myGov environment, by using their Digital ID, without the need to also log in to their USI account.
