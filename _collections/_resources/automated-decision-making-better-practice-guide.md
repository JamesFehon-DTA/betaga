Technological advances have made it easier for agencies to make automated decisions. However, it is well recognised that automated systems have the potential to significantly impact the rights and privacy of individuals. Agencies need to find a balance between innovation and ensuring automation is used only where appropriate.

The key message for agencies is that the customer must be at the centre of service delivery.

This guide is intended to be a practical tool for agencies and includes a checklist designed to assist managers and project officers during the design and implementation of new automated systems and with ongoing assurance processes once a system is operational.

The structure of this guide reflects the areas that require particular care when developing and managing automated systems including:

1. guiding principles for assessing the suitability of automated systems
2. ensuring compliance with administrative law requirements
3. ensuring the design of an automated system complies with privacy requirements
4. establishing appropriate governance of automated systems projects
5. developing quality assurance processes to maintain continued accuracy
6. ensuring the transparency and accountability of the system and its accompanying processes.

The principles in the guide apply whether an agency is building an automated system in-house or has contracted with an external provider to build the system.
