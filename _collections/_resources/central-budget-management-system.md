The Central Budget Management System (CBMS) manages the flow of financial information between Finance and Commonwealth Government entities to facilitate cash and appropriation management, preparation of budget documentation and financial reporting.

Users are required to submit an Access Request form, approved by an entity’s Chief Financial Officer. Training is provided as a requirement for access, and it is useful for understanding the processes associated with the different tasks in the system.

The Reference Date Set provides the framework for data entry and reporting in CBMS.

For further information, please contact [cbms@finance.gov.au](mailto:cbms@finance.gov.au). The Finance Service Centre provides a single point of contact for CBMS (Legacy) and CBMS (Redeveloped) support matters including user access, incident management, and end user support queries.
