Responsible agency: **AusTender**  
  
The *Contractor reporting, integrity information solution* (CRIIS) helps to enhance transparency in Government contingent workforce processes and support the engagement of temporary workers.

The CRIIS is a web-based platform to support key stakeholders delivering services to the Commonwealth through various whole of Australian Government panel arrangements.

The initial release is now live and will support the [People panel phase 2 (labour hire services)](https://www.finance.gov.au/government/procurement/whole-australian-government-procurement/people-panel/phase-2-labour-hire-services) and the [Management advisory services (MAS) panel](https://www.finance.gov.au/government/procurement/whole-australian-government-procurement/management-advisory-services-panel). CRIIS is in scope to expand to include the People panel phase 1 (recruitment and search services), People panel phase 3 (professional contractor services), and other panels as they are onboarded to the platform.
