GovTEAMS is the collaboration service for the Australian Public Service. It supports government employees and their industry partners to connect, share information and work together across organisational and geographical boundaries.

Agencies should use GovTEAMS OFFICIAL to:

* collaborate and connect with anyone - locally, nationally, and internationally, using Microsoft Office 365
* work on projects in a secure environment (up to OFFICIAL:Sensitive)
* video, phone, chat, send posts and collaborate with project partners, in real time
* share documents securely without worrying about version control
* host online meetings, live events, and webinars
* connect with communities with similar goals or projects
* work efficiently, saving time and money.

There are 3 membership types:

* Full access memberships for APS employees.
* Guest memberships for non-APS employees. Guests need to be invited by a full access member.
* Partner memberships for non-APS employees actively engaging with the public service.

See the [Membership types](https://www.govteams.gov.au/membership-types) page on the GovTEAMS website for an overview of each membership type.
