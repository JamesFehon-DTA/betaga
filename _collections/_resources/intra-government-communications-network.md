Responsible agency: **Department of Finance**

The Intra-government Communications Network (ICON)provides an unmetered and cost-effective telecommunication service, connecting over 130 Australian Government agencies and service providers, through approximately 3800 point-to-point fibre optic links within the Australian Capital Territory.

The network of fibre optic links allows information to be communicated securely, with a classification up to PROTECTED, without the need for additional encryption. ICON enables buildings occupied by a Commonwealth entity to connect to one of the following:

* a building occupied by a different Commonwealth entity
* a building occupied by the same Commonwealth entity
* a building occupied by a Commonwealth entity service provider (e.g. a data centre).

ICON began in 1991 as a private communications network between the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade sites and has expanded to 150,000km of fibre across the capital.

Connections are speed and protocol independent, meaning that entities can determine the technology that best meets their requirements. In effect, the data volume and speed transfer are limited only by the end-entities’ active equipment.
