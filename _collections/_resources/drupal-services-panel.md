The [Drupal services panel](https://www.govcms.gov.au/dsp) is a list of approved suppliers. It includes small to medium enterprises equipped to work with Drupal and the GovCMS platform.

The panel was created to help organisations find Drupal specialists and to simplify contract management arrangements.

The panel provides 3 service categories, enabling agencies to tailor contracts to their project needs:

* Category 1 is focused on connecting agencies with the suppliers with specialised skills (resources)
* Category 2 is about fixed-priced services, such as assessment workshops or predefined service packages
* Category 3 is based around suppliers offering Digital Experience Platform (DXP) tools and services.
