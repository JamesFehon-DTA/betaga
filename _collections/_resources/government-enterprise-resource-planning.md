## Details

Direct link: [*www.digital.gov.au/initiatives/enterprise-resource-planning*](http://www.digital.gov.au/initiatives/enterprise-resource-planning)   
Responsible agency: **Services Australia**

The *Shared Services transformation program* and GovERP were retired and replaced with a new APS ERP approach. The Department of Finance website hosts further information on the [new APS ERP approach](https://www.finance.gov.au/government/new-aps-erp-approach).

GovERP, as part of the *Shared Services transformation program* was intended to provide SAP-based back-office services including financial, human resources, procurement and reporting as a common platform for government. It also intended to incorporate a TechnologyOne and Aurion solution for smaller entities.

Services Australia have continued ERP development works, including drawing on and repurposing some of was built as GovERP, under the name Services Australia ERP (SA ERP).

## Reuse assessment

The GovERP reuse assessment is now part of the new [APS ERP approach](https://www.finance.gov.au/government/new-aps-erp-approach).

An independent panel of technical experts led the assessment, with support by the Digital Transformation Agency (DTA). Engagement took place across the public service.

The government commissioned report contains 5 key observations and recommendations for reuse. The final report was presented to the Minister for Finance, the Hon Katy Gallagher, on 28 June 2024.

The digital.gov.au website hosts the [GovERP reuse assessment report](https://www.digital.gov.au/initiatives/enterprise-resource-planning) (full text).

## Technical designs

As part of the GovERP reuse assessment, work was undertaken to align ERP value streams to work undertaken on the GovERP programme. This included determining what components were built and are available for future reuse. The following designs should be referred to for detail:

* [*GovERP finance solution*](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/goverp-finance-solution)
* [*GovERP procure-to-pay (P2P) solution*](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/goverp-procure-to-pay-solution)
* [*GovERP hire-to-retire (H2R) solution*](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/goverp-hire-to-retire-solution)
* [*Expense8 travel and expense management system (TEMS)*](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/expense8-tems)

## Architectural artefacts

Artefacts surfaced during the GovERP reuse assessment, including architectural diagrams, Signavio process documentation reports, and workflows, reports, interfaces, conversions, enhancements and forms (WRICEFs), are available in the [*Australian Government Architecture repository*](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/design/australian-government-architecture-repository).
