Responsible agency: **Department of Health and Aged Care**

My QuitBuddy is an app that helps people with their efforts to quit smoking and vaping. It provides tracking systems to chart progress, tips and distractions to overcome cravings, and facts about the health impacts of smoking.

The app is easily customised. People can:

* define their objective, whether that’s choosing to 'Quit Now', ‘Continue Quitting’ or preparing to 'Quit Later'
* set their goals and understand their motivations to quit
* nominate friends or family who can support them
* view their progress, including a count of every day, hour and minute vape or smoke-free, and how much money they have saved
* nominate any ‘Danger Times’ so that My QuitBuddy will send them notifications to keep them on track
* engage in a range of distractions to occupy the mind and hands through moments of craving
* read helpful messages from other people who are quitting and leave messages for others to read.
