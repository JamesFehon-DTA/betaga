## Details

Responsible agency: **Bureau of Meteorology**

The Bureau of Meteorology has a custom HPC facility designed for weather prediction and climate research. The facility uses powerful supercomputers such as Cray XC40 (Australis) and Cray XC50 (Australis II), which provide significant computational power. It is suited to bespoke, batch workloads requiring massively parallel computational capacity.

The facility enables increased data sharing and collaboration with other government agencies, enhancing research capacity and supporting interoperability and operational efficiency during peak times.

The facility has a disaster recovery system in place that ensures resilience and security of digital services. It is highly efficient, due to high computational power through technologies such as HPC.
