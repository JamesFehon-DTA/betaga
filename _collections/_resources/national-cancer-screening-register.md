## Details

Direct link: [*www.ncsr.gov.au*](https://www.ncsr.gov.au/)  
Responsible agency: **Department of Health, Disability and Ageing**

The National Cancer Screening Register (NCSR) is a digital platform that supports the [National Bowel Cancer Screening Program](https://health.gov.au/nbcsp), [National Cervical Screening Program](https://www.health.gov.au/ncsp), and [National Lung Cancer Screening Program](https://health.gov.au/nlcsp).

These programs encourage eligible Australians to screen regularly, helping detect signs of cancer early, when treatment is most effective.

The register:

* provides a single electronic record for each participant
* delivers a secure, national infrastructure for collecting, storing, analysing and reporting screening data.

Participants can access the NCSR Participant Portal via myGov to:

* update their personal details
* view screening information
* manage their participation in the programs.
