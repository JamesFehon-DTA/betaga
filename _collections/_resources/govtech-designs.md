## Details

GovTech designs all have the commonality of seeking to support a modern digital government across the public sector in contrast to the siloed approach to entity-based solutions.

Designs include approaches to problem solving innovation and collaboration by breaking away from traditional procurement and sourcing approaches as well as identify, building, and deploying the GovTech building blocks of information, platforms, and services.

GovTech designs are grouped as per their alignment to the relevant GovTech capabilities:

* Government as a platform (GaaP) Designs
* Government as a service (GaaS) Designs
* Collaboration and innovation Designs

## GovTech Government as a Platform (GaaP) Designs

The following GovTech platforms are used across Australian Government to support or enable:

* [APSLearn](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/learnhub) - compliance, learning and development for Australian Public Sector (APS) staff and required third parties
* [Australian National Data Integration Infrastructure (ANDII)](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/australian-national-data-integration-infrastructure-andii) - hosting and access to whole-of-government critical data assets
* [data.gov.au](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/datagovau) - facilitation of common access to government public data
* [BuyICT](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/buyict) and [Digital Marketplace](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/digital-marketplace) - connecting government digital and ICT buyers and sellers through several different marketplaces and with standardised terms and conditions suitable for government contracts
* [Dataplace](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/dataplace) and [NationalMap](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/nationalmap) - finding and sharing Australian Government data
* [GovCMS](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/govcms) - developing and deploying web content management for Australian Government websites
* [GovTeams (OFFICIAL)](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/govteams-official) and [GovTeams (PROTECTED)](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/govteams-protected) – cross-entity collaboration and information sharing in both open and protected environment
* [Intra-government Communications Network (ICON)](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/intra-government-communications-network-icon) - secure networking across government entities
* [myGov](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/mygov) - Person to Government (P2G) and Government to Person (G2P) digital interactions.

## GovTech Government as a Service (GaaS) Designs

The following GovTech services are established across Australian Government to support or enable:

* [Australian Government Data Catalogue](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/australian-government-data-catalogue) - registering of government data assets
* [Document Verification Service](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/document-verification-service-dvs) - submissions and verification of official government documents used in verification of identity or access to services
* [Face Verification Service](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/face-verification-service-fvs) - submission and verification of image-based official government documents used in verification of identity or access to services
* [Federated Authenticated Service (VANguard)](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/federated-authentication-service) - federated identity and access management for official government solutions
* [gov.au domain administration system](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/govau-domain-administration-system) - internet domain registration and management services for government entities
* [Observatory](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/observatory-govau) - monitoring and reporting of the technical availability and performance of Australian Government websites
* [Australian Government Digital Identity System](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/agdis) (AGDIS), comprising of [MyID](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/myid) and [Relationship Authorisation Manager](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/relationship-authorisation-manager) (RAM) - verifying identity online for accessing government services or sharing sensitive documents.

## GovTech Collaboration and Innovation Designs

The following GovTech design tools are used across Australian Government to support or enable:

* [API.gov.au](https://api.gov.au/) - interoperability and implementation requirements of Australian Government Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
* [Digital Experience Toolkit](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/digital-service-standard-v2-guides-and-tools) – development of government digital experiences for government entities and authorised third parties that meet the requirements of the [Digital Experience policy](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/digital-experience)
* [Evaluation of the whole-of-government trial of Microsoft 365 Copilot](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/evaluation-whole-government-trial-microsoft-365-copilot) and [Guidance for the Pilot Australian Government artificial intelligence assurance framework](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/guidance-pilot-australian-government-artificial-intelligence-assurance-framework) – enabling APS staff to experiment with generative AI tools in a safe and responsible way.
