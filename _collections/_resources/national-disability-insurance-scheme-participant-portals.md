The [National Disability Insurance Scheme](https://my.gov.au/en/about/help/mygov-website/link-services-to-your-account/link-national-disability-insurance-scheme) (NDIS) is an Australian government-funded scheme that provides funding for supports and services to eligible people with permanent and significant disabilities. The NDIS business system manages the user interaction through two participant portals:

* myplace portal
* my NDIS portal, also known as Provider and Participant Communication Environment (PACE).

These portals allow NDIS participants to

* oversee their plan
* view funding
* manage claims
* interact with providers.

Both of these portals need to be linked and can be accessed through user’s myGov account.

While both of these portals are in use, myplace portal is an older portal developed under the old NDIS system, and will be gradually replaced by newer, more user-friendly and easier to access my PACE.
