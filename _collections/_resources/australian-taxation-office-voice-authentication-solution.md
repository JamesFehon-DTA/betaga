Responsible agency: **Australian Taxation Office**

The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) has implemented a user-centric voice biometric solution that confirms a person’s identity by matching their voice characteristics to a stored voiceprint. People can be authenticated using their voice across multiple channels, including the ATO app and over the phone.

This solution enhances security and streamlines user access to services. By utilising unique voice patterns, the system reduces reliance on traditional passwords, PINs and security questions. This minimises the risk of unauthorised access and identity theft.
