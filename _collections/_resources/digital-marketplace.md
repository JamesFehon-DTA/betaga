The Digital Marketplace brings together government buyers and digital sellers in a simple and transparent environment. It makes the process of sourcing digital products and services easier, faster, and more cost-effective.

The marketplace panel includes suppliers of:

* ICT labour hire
* ICT professional and consulting services.

By providing a robust and competitive panel, the Digital Marketplace Panel 2 ensures that small and medium enterprises have the opportunity to participate in government procurement. The platform's transparency in ICT labour hire and professional services procurements supports data-driven investment decisions by the government.

All federal, state, territory and local government agencies can use the Digital Marketplace Panel 2. This includes government universities and government-owned corporations.
