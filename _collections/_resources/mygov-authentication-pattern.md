The myGov authentication pattern allows individuals to safely sign in to various government services using their myGov credentials.

Users have the choice to sign in with a username and password, Digital ID or a Passkey. They can manage their sign in details and 2 factor authentication choice in their myGov account.

The myGov authentication pattern gives user the choice of entry point into their government services, allowing them to skip the myGov authenticated space and go directly to the Government online service.
