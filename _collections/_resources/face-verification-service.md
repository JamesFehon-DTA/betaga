Responsible agency: **Department of Home Affairs**

The *Face verification service* (FVS) enables comparison of an individual’s facial image against the pre-existing biometric template associated with the individual’s identity document.

FVS can only be used with the individual’s consent.

The service:

* makes access to government services more convenient for customers by avoiding the need to attend a shopfront
* provides strong privacy, security and oversight to online biometric identity verification
* helps prevent identity theft by detecting fraudulent documents that use stolen identity information.

The FVS is only used by Australian Government agencies.

In the future, local government, state and territory governments and private sector organisations will use the FVS, subject to participation agreements that outline strong privacy, security and oversight requirements. This will include provision of the expressed consent from individuals.
