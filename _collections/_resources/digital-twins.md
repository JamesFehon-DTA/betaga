## Details

A digital twin is dynamic digital representation of a real-world object or system. Using both real-time and historic data, digital twins are able to present a multi-dimensional digital replica of both potential and actual physical assets, processes, systems etc. and to simulate their predicted futures.

In 2022, the DTA performed discovery on the use of digital twins as an emerging technology, to gain a broader understanding of the use cases, ecosystem and to better define the whole of government opportunity in this capability.

Input was received from more than 15 international, state and federal government agencies, academia, independent bodies, non-for-profit and private organisations.

The discovery identified 12 opportunities and 6 key recommendations.

Further information is available from the DTA on request.
