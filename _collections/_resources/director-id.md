A Director Identification Number (director ID) is a unique 15-digit identifier required for directors of Australian companies. Managed by the Australian Business Registry Services (ABRS), it helps prevent fraudulent identities and promotes transparency.

A person will need a director ID if they're an eligible officer of:

* a company, registered Australian body, or registered foreign company under the Corporations Act 2001 (Corporations Act)
* an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation registered under the Corporations (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander) Act 2006 (CATSI Act).

An eligible officer is a person who is appointed as either:

* a director
* an alternate director who is acting in that capacity.

To be a director under the Corporations Act, they must:

* be an individual who is at least 18 years old
* not be disqualified from managing corporations, unless the appointment is made with the permission of ASIC or the Court.

A person must apply for their own director ID to verify their identity. No one can apply on their behalf.
