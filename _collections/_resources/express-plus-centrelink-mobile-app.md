The Express Plus Centrelink mobile app allows people to manage their Centrelink information directly from their mobile devices. It provides people with the ability to:

* check and update their personal details
* report their income
* check payments and entitlements
* track claims
* manage appointments
* access digital copies of their healthcare and concession cards.

The Express Plus Centrelink mobile app complies with the *Privacy Act 1988* (Cth) in terms of the type of information that is collected, why the information is collected and with whom information is shared. For security reasons, everyone using the app must have their own account. Users must have a myGov account linked to their Centrelink account.
