## Details

Responsible agency: **Department of Health and Aged Care**

The Australian Government is expanding the existing NDIS worker screening system to create a national worker registration scheme for the aged care sector, using an expanded ICT solution to ensure older people are better protected.

This system will provide national oversight for worker screening, beginning with more robust security screening checks from November 2025 and broader changes planned for mid-2026, as part of a phased implementation to support worker and sector readiness.

The scheme aims to professionalise the workforce by establishing training and skills requirements, supporting better quality care, and providing career opportunities for aged care workers.
