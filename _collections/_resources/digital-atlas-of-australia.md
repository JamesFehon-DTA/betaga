Responsible agency: **Geoscience Australia**  
  
The Digital Atlas of Australia brings together, curates and connects trusted national datasets on Australia’s geography, people, economy and the environment in a central platform. User-friendly maps and tools enable users to explore and visualise data by location with ease.

Content in the Digital Atlas can also be downloaded or connected into other platforms and technologies using APIs.

The Digital Atlas is a key initiative highlighted in the government's [*Data and digital government strategy*](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/strategy/data-and-digital-government-strategy). By enabling data to be managed and shared as a valuable national asset, the Digital Atlas is helping to support better informed place-based policies, programs and services.

**Integrated Geospatial Infrastructure**

The Digital Atlas is powered by an Integrated Geospatial Infrastructure, a digital ecosystem enabling data and services to be shared and integrated seamlessly across borders, systems, technologies and platforms.

The ecosystem is a cloud-based architecture built using commercial off-the-shelf ArcGIS software from Esri. The solution ensures interoperability and scalability.

**Content in the Digital Atlas**

Data in the Digital Atlas is from organisations recognised as authorities in their fields.

Custodians work within the Digital Atlas ecosystem to curate and integrate their trusted, open data guided by established standards and processes to ensure quality, reliability and currency. Responsibility for maintaining and updating content remains with custodians.
