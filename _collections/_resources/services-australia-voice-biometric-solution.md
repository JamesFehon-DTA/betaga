Responsible agency: **Services Australia**

A voice biometric solution is used by Services Australia to confirm a person’s identity by matching the characteristics of their voice to the stored voiceprints managed by the agency.

Based on spectrogram analysis, the voiceprint creates a mathematical model that represents the unique features of a person’s voice that distinct them from the others.

User’s who create a voiceprint:

* can prove their identity faster when they call Services Australia
* don’t need to use or remember a Personal Identification Number (PIN)
* don’t need to answer security questions when they call Services Australia.

Individuals can create a voiceprint by phoning Centrelink or using the [Express Plus Centrelink mobile app](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/what-you-can-do-your-express-plus-centrelink-mobile-app#createvoiceprint).
