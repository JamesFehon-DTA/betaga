The [guide to developing an APP privacy policy](http://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/privacy-guidance-for-organisations-and-government-agencies/more-guidance/guide-to-developing-an-app-privacy-policy) helps APP entities prepare and maintain an APP privacy policy.

It provides tips and a process for developing a privacy policy, as well as a checklist to help ensure that all relevant aspects of developing an APP privacy policy have been considered, and to assist with regular checks to ensure that the policy remains up to date.

The guide should be read together with the full text of the [APPs](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/australian-privacy-principles) and [APP guidelines](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/australian-privacy-principles-guidelines).
