The [Parliamentary workplace support service](https://pwss.gov.au/) (PWSS) case management system is the internal system used by the PWSS to manage and track cases of misconduct, conflict, and work health and safety risks in the parliamentary workplace.

The system enables the following functionalities:

* incident response
* case intake and resolution
* support, counselling and provision of educational resources
* secure management and confidentiality of personal information collected
* 24/7 support.

The design is an example of how a case management digital investment may be structured, reused or applied, in order to meet the intent of the [Case management standard](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/case-management-standard).
