## Details

Direct link: [*www.communitygrants.gov.au*](http://www.communitygrants.gov.au)  
Responsible agency: **Department of Social Services**  
  
The [Community grants hub](http://www.communitygrants.gov.au/) provides a shared-services arrangement to deliver grant administration services on behalf of Australian Government client agencies.

Client agencies are responsible for grant policy and the development of grant programs. The hub supports the administration of grant programs at the direction of policy owners and consistent with the requirements of the [Commonwealth grants rules and principles 2024](https://www.finance.gov.au/government/commonwealth-grants/commonwealth-grants-rules-and-principles-2024).

The hub administration services include:

* planning and defining the details of a program, and understanding how it will be implemented to achieve intended outcomes
* advertising the grant and selecting grant recipients
* creating, populating, varying and executing grant agreements or contracts
* monitoring and managing assurance of provider performance.

The hub can be used by agencies to achieve the reuse of existing designs, patterns, and investment policy requirement as per the [Grant management standard](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/grant-management-standard).
