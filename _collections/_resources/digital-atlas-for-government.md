The Digital Atlas for government is a secure environment within the [Digital Atlas of Australia](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/design/digital-atlas-australia). It allows authenticated users from all levels of government to share, create and collaborate in real-time.

It allows users to:

* view their own data alongside trusted national data
* access a suite of geospatial and analytical tools
* create and share data, maps and apps
* collaborate securely with other government users.

The Digital Atlas is a key initiative highlighted in the government's [*Data and digital government strategy*](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/strategy/data-and-digital-government-strategy). By enabling data to be managed and shared as a valuable national asset, the Digital Atlas is helping to support better informed place-based policies, programs and services.

**Integrated Geospatial Infrastructure**

The Digital Atlas for government is part of a broader digital ecosystem, powered by an Integrated Geospatial Infrastructure. This infrastructure enables data and services to be shared and integrated seamlessly across borders, systems, technologies and platforms.

Custodians of trusted data can use the Digital Atlas for government to prepare, integrate or host content to be shared via the publicly accessible Digital Atlas of Australia.

The ecosystem is a cloud-based architecture built using commercial off-the-shelf ArcGIS software from Esri. The solution ensures interoperability and scalability.

The Digital Atlas for government uses VANguard to provide secure access to authenticated users.
