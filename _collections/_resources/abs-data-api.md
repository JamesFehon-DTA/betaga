The ABS Data API (Beta) allows users to request detailed ABS statistics including economic, social and Census data. Data is published after embargo is lifted at 11:30am and is usually available by 12:30pm (Canberra time) on release day.

The API provides detailed access to a wide range of ABS releases but cannot be guaranteed to contain all data released in xlsx files via the website.

The ABS Data API uses the Statistical Data and Metadata Exchange (SDMX) standard. Data is available in XML, JSON and CSV. Data available in the ABS Data API can be browsed in a human readable form using the [ABS Data Explorer](https://explore.data.abs.gov.au/).
