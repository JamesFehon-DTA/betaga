## Details

*Payment utility* is a SAP-based centralised payments platform that delivers payments to recipients through multiple methods.

*Payment utility* was built under Services Australia's Welfare Payments Infrastructure Transformation (WPIT) program, developed using the SAP S/4 HANA technology platform. The platform is tailored for government and provides the ability to support multiple tenancies, separating data from each agency and program. It is an enterprise finance structure that standardises finance processes and delivers payment capability for inbound and outbound payments using current domestic and international payment schemes.

The platform started delivering payments in 2019 and now delivers the majority of Centrelink based payments, including Families, Parenting, and Pensions. The platform was designed as a scalable service that can be reused across government agencies in an efficient and cost-effective manner.
