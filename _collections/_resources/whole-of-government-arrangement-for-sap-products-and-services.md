Responsible agency: **Digital Transformation Agency**

DTA established a whole-of-government arrangement with SAP to make it easier for Australian Government agencies to buy SAP products and services.

Whole-of-government arrangements cover goods and services that are commonly used across government. They are put in place to:

* maximise market benefits
* deliver efficiencies and savings
* provide benefits and pricing not previously available for smaller agencies.

This arrangement only applies after agencies have:

* conducted a formal approach to market
* selected SAP as provider of required products and services.
