[National driver licence facial recognition solution](https://www.idmatch.gov.au/access-our-services) (NDLFRS) enables sharing and matching of facial recognition-based identity verification data, using driver's license images.

The purpose of this system is to protect Australian people from identity theft, to manage and prevent crime, increase road safety and improve identity verification.

The NDLFRS centrally stores biometric templates created from facial images provided by states and territories. Each road agency retains complete control over the facial images and other identity information associated with their driver licences.
