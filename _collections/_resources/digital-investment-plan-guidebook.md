This guide supports government agencies to develop a digital investment plan by bringing together minimum content requirements, best-practice information and templates to guide development.

It accompanies the [Digital Investment Plan Policy](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/policy/digital-investment-plan-policy), which seeks to align the approach to digital planning across government.

A digital investment plan outlines the short, medium and long-term digital goals and initiatives of an agency. ​It also aligns digital investments with the strategic priorities, business needs and user expectations of the agency.

All non-corporate Commonwealth entities subject to the Digital and ICT Investment Oversight Framework are required to submit a plan to the Digital Transformation Agency once a year.

The guidebook includes:

* minimum content requirements for a DIP
* best-practice content guidance for each section of the plan
* templates to use when developing a plan
* a glossary of important terms.
