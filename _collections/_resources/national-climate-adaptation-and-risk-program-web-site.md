Responsible agency: **Australian Climate Service**

The National Climate Risk Assessment is being delivered by the Australian Climate Service in liaison with the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW). It aims to establish a baseline for new and emerging climate risks, as well as to create a National Adaptation Plan and a framework that will inform national priorities in the area of climate change.

The first pass assessment identified 56 nationally significant climate risks, which have been assessed in accordance with the National Climate Risk Methodology. The risks have been assessed against 10 priority hazards such are bushfires, floods, cyclones etc., to determine key impacts and climate risks for Australia over the next century.

This website holds information about the assessment process allowed for the development and refinement of climate risks within the systems of national importance. It considers how risks can compound, cascade, and aggregate across multiple systems. In total, seven key systems have been assessed:

* Defence and national security system
* Economy, trade and finance system
* Health and social services
* Infrastructure and built environment
* Natural environment
* Primary industries and food
* Regional and remote communities
