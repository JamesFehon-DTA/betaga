## Details

Responsible agency: **Australian Electoral Commission**

The Indigo program is a major modernisation initiative currently being delivered by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC). The program aims to replace several legacy systems and an outdated infrastructure in AEC and to improve the efficiency and integrity of federal electoral processes, as well as electoral data security, by leveraging modern technology.

One of the key legacy systems that will be updated is a payroll system for temporary election workers, which will be transitioned to Cloud and will comply with the whole-of-government Hosting Certification Framework.

Progress on the Indigo Program is noted at a high level, and reported on, in the AEC's [2024-25 Corporate Plan](https://www.aec.gov.au/about_aec/Publications/corporate-plan/index.htm) and [Annual Report 2023-24](https://www.aec.gov.au/about_aec/publications/annual-report/).
