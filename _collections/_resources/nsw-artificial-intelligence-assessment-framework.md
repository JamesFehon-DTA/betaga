The [*NSW artificial intelligence assessment framework*](https://www.digital.nsw.gov.au/policy/artificial-intelligence/nsw-artificial-intelligence-assessment-framework) (AIAF) assists NSW agencies to design, build and use AI-enabled products and solutions. The framework ensures the safe and responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI), including AI governance and oversight, risk management and mitigation, ethics, capability and capacity building, and continuous improvement.

This framework enables agencies to evaluate and mitigate risks associated with their AI solutions, as well as a tool that lets them evaluate when to escalate the risks to the AI Review Committee, if the residual risk remains high or greater following the application of all mitigation and controls.

The aim of the framework is to support the NSW Government to innovate with AI technology, while making sure it is used safely and securely, with clear accountability for the design and use of AI Systems.
