Responsible agency: **Civil Aviation Safety Authority**

myCASA is an online portal that enables people to engage with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA), accessing certain services and managing their information.

People can use the portal to apply for an aviation reference number, register and view details about drones, obtain accreditations, and view their licences and certificates. It provides access to CASA’s online learning system, AviationWorx, and can be used to carry digital versions of a person’s:

* Aeronautical Radio Operator Certificate (AROC)
* Operator accreditation certificate (excluded category).

myCASA is integrated with Digital ID, allowing people to create an account and verify their identity using the MyID app. People can also create an account directly with the myCASA portal.

The myCASA website uses GovCMS, which is built using Drupal.
