The *Parliamentary document management system* (PDMS) connects Australian Government agencies and Parliament through a transformational workflow management system, under the whole-of-government *Parliamentary workflow solution* (PWS) Program.

The PDMS improves parliamentary workflow between agencies and ministerial offices, helping users to drive efficiency and enables them to focus on their core priorities.

PDMS supports ministerial level correspondence, briefings and submissions, parliamentary questions on notice, Senate estimates briefings and questions on notice, executive level communications, and parliamentary inquiries and general communications and media, up to the PROTECTED level.

Since its introduction in 2013, PDMS supports:

* over 70 Australian Government agencies
* an average of 45,000 active users per week
* over 250,000 registered users
* over 400,000 records created per year.

This is an example of a business process and workflow system that manages documents throughout creating, drafting, approving, quality checking, actioning, publishing and closing.

The design is an example of how a business process and workflow digital investment may be structured, reused or applied, in order to meet the intent of the [Business process and workflow standard.](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/business-process-and-workflow-standard)
