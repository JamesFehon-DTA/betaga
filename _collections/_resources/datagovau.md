Responsible agency: **Australian Bureau of Statistics**

Data.gov.au is the central source of data published by Australian federal, state and local government agencies. The beta platform is targeted at improving data transparency, enabling easier access to government data and promoting public engagement and collaboration.

To this end, data.gov.au already hosts a wide range of anonymised datasets, including publicly funded research data and datasets from private institutions. All levels of government are encouraged to use the platform to share public data – with agencies retaining control as custodians of the datasets they make available.

The use of data.gov.au by federal government agencies is prescribed in the [Information Asset Management Standard](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/information-asset-management-standard). To comply with this standard, agencies must publish appropriately anonymised non-sensitive government data as open by default, on or linked through [data.gov.au](https://data.gov.au/home).

Many of the datasets on data.gov.au can be visualised using mapping tools. Datasets that contain a geospatial field (such as latitude and longitude) can be downloaded and viewed the [Digital Atlas of Australia.](https://digital.atlas.gov.au/)

The data.gov.au user guide assists people to interact with the platform more easily and effectively, including information on:

* creating an account and providing access to open data
* publishing data either manually or automatically
* managing metadata
* updating existing datasets
* using the right data formats
* searching and using navigation tools and portals
* getting support and providing feedback.
