Responsible agency: **Australian Bureau of Statistics**

Big data, timely insights: phase 2 is part of the ABS’ 10-year modernisation program to replace its legacy IT systems.

Big data, timely insights: phase 1 delivered foundation capabilities in the cloud environment. Phase 2 will deliver more timely and reliable information for decision-makers and the community, maximising the value that ABS data provides. It will also enable the ABS to produce important new data, including a complete monthly measure of the Consumer price index.

The program will support the transition of key data assets to a secure cloud environment, allowing the ABS to reduce risks it currently faces to the production and accuracy of Australia's key economic statistics.
