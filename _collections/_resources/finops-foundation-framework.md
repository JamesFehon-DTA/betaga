FinOps Foundation Framework is a structured operational approach and cultural practice aimed at optimising the business benefits of cloud computing. It facilitates timely, data-informed decisions and fosters financial accountability by promoting collaboration between engineering, finance, and business teams.

The FinOps Foundation, a project of the Linux Foundation, may support entities in adopting the Cloud FinOps Standard by providing best practices, resources, and a collaborative community to enhance cloud financial management. The FinOps principles produced by the FinOps Foundation, may be referred to by entities. The principles are:

* Teams need to collaborate
* Decisions are driven by business value of cloud
* Everyone takes ownership for their cloud usage
* FinOps data should be accessible and timely
* A centralised team drives FinOps
* Take advantage of the variable cost model of the cloud

The Foundation also provides a variety of [individual training and certification programs](https://learn.finops.org/), including the [FinOps Certified Practitioner](https://learn.finops.org/page/finops-certified-practitioner) and [FinOps Certified Professional](https://learn.finops.org/path/finops-certified-professional).
