*Standard business reporting* (SBR) is a standard approach to online or digital record keeping that simplifies business to government reporting.

Software developers build SBR rules into business/accounting software to make it SBR-enabled. Businesses then use SBR-enabled software to report to government using information they record as part of running their business.

SBR uses a web-based data exchange. It receives secured messages and routes them to the appropriate government agency to satisfy business-to-government reporting obligations.

SBR allows businesses to significantly reduce the time spent collating information, filling in forms and submitting reports to government.
