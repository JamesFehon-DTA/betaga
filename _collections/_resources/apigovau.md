api.gov.au has been designed to give technology developers, researchers, and other parties access to a range of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that can be used to integrate systems access to a range of functions from across government. It includes Australian Government - API Design Standards to provide a reference point in the design phase of a new API development process.

The platform is in beta as of November 2024.

[api.gov.au](https://api.gov.au/) was developed as a cross-government platform to provide guidance on API development requirements and to serve as a repository for the storage and distribution of Commonwealth entity-developed APIs. The broad goals of this national API design standard are to:

* create a technical API design standard to be used across the Whole of Government (WofG) for cross-jurisdictional data sharing
* improve overall quality of the APIs being shared, as well as the literacy around APIs and integrations
* build a cross-jurisdictional working group of API experts who can continue to foster and champion the standard across the Whole of Government (WofG).

The site provides additional background context on the development of the National API Design Standards (NAPIDS), including reasoning regarding the selection of HTTP REST as the design standard for inter-government API development.

It provides templates that can be used to build standardised APIs, guidance on developing support materials, naming conventions, version control, and security requirements.

Utilising the API classification categories on the api.gov.au site:

If your API is considered a **System Level** **API**, and is custom developed, it is **recommended** that you use the design standard as this will assist in developing Process or Experience Level APIs if they are required in future.

If your API is a **Process Level API** you **should** apply the design standard, as often a process level API will be tailored for re-usability.

If your API is an **Experience Level API** then the design standard **must** be applied.

The National API Design Standards:

* arerecommended for custom developed, System Level APIs to assist developing Process or Experience Level APIs if required.
* should be applied to Process Level APIs tailored for re-usability
* must be applied to all Experience level APIs

The design standard does not apply to third-party system level APIs such as those available as ‘out-of-the-box’ or as part of SaaS platform, e.g. Salesforce APIs or ArcGIS APIs. However, the standard may apply if you were looking to re-expose these APIs as Experience Level APIs for wider consumption.

In addition to setting standards and providing development assistance, the site functions as a GitHub repository. Entities can upload their APIs for utilisation by developers and other key stakeholders.
