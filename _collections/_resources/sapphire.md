## Details

Responsible agency: **Department of Health and Aged Care.**

Sapphire is the National Health and Medical Research Council's (NHMRC) technology solution for supporting end-to-end management of all Medical Research Endowment Account grant opportunities (GOs) as well as Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF) GOs administered by NHMRC on behalf of the Department of Health and Aged Care.

Sapphire is used by researchers, reviewers, administering institutions, eligible organisations and NHMRC staff to undertake a range of grant-related activities from application, through assessment, to the award and grant administration.

Sapphire has been developed and implemented in stages over a number of years, to serve as a reliable and functional system for the future.

Sapphire replaced NHMRC’s legacy Research Grants Management System (RGMS), which was decommissioned from general use in January 2022.
