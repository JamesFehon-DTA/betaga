Responsible agency: **Australian Financial Security Authority**

The [*Personal properties security register*](https://www.ppsr.gov.au/glossary#ppsr) (PPSR) is a national online register that provides information about security interest over personal property such as boats, cars or other personal items.

People can search the PPSR to see if someone has registered a security interest over personal property. This is useful to know before buying or leasing personal items or lending money.

The [PPSR](https://www.ppsr.gov.au/glossary#ppsr) was commissioned on 30 January 2012 and replaced many state-based registers, such as *Register of encumbered vehicles* (REVS) and other vehicle registers and the Register of Company Charges, to form one national register.
