## Details

Direct link: [*www.domainname.gov.au*](http://www.domainname.gov.au)  
Responsible agency: **Department of Finance**

The [gov.au domain administration system](https://www.domainname.gov.au/) provides a framework, policies, and guidance on:

* eligibility and allocation of gov.au domain names
* how applications for domain names are assessed
* the use of non-gov.au domain names
* exemptions.

The Department of Finance manages gov.au domains in consultation with auDA, the industry regulatory body, and state and territory governments.

Gov.au domain name data is passed on to the .au registry operator ([Identity Digital Australia](https://identitydigital.au/)). The Registry maintains a “master list” of gov.au domain names, which is used to point internet users to the right websites based on the domain name they request.

The gov.au domain is reserved for use by Australian, all state and territory entities apart from Northern Territory and Tasmania, as well as local government entities.

Domain registration and administration services can be accessed via service request forms on the [gov.au domain administration system](https://www.domainname.gov.au/) website.
