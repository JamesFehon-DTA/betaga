The DTA maintains a repository of artefacts developed by the Commonwealth. This repository includes materials that:

* have been developed in line with solution development, and will be useful for assessment of suitability of previous investment, or actioning of reuse
* provide entities guidance in considering their needs and solution options

The repository is presently hosted in a beta state on the [GovTEAMS (Official)](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/govteams-official) collaboration platform, utilising SharePoint for document storage and access management.
