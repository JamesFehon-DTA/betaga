Responsible agency: **Australian Bureau of Statistics and Australian Institute of Health and Welfare**

The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) have developed an underlying infrastructure for the National Disability Data Asset called the Australian National Data Integration Infrastructure (ANDII). The infrastructure enables data governance and streamlined data sharing arrangements. The ANDII is also an ICT solution, supported by linkage and analytical capabilities. The ANDII ICT solution is cloud based which provides opportunities for enhanced security, scalability and controlled data sharing. It provides contemporary tools for data preparation, analysis and code management. It supports repeatable data pipelines as well as more ad-hoc or once off data analytic tasks.
