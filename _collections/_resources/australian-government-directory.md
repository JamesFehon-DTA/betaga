The Australian Government Directory is a comprehensive resource that provides information about the structures, organisations and key people in the Australian Government.

The register contains information about 1,322 government bodies, their key roles, functions and structure, as well as state and territory government organisations.

It also provides information about ministerial portfolios and the departments, entities and companies associated with each of the portfolios.

This design relates to the [Information Asset Management standard](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/information-asset-management-standard), that ensures all information assets in Australian Government are managed in a secure and efficient manner. In the context of the Australian Government Directory, that means that any information presented in this directory is secure, protected from unauthorised access, change or removal, and that information available remains true, accurate, protected and easy to find.
