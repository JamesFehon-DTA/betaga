Express Plus Child Support is a mobile app that allows users to manage their child support information directly from their mobile devices.

The app is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Each person must have their own account in the app for security reasons.

* check and update personal details
* report income
* check payments and entitlements

* Good user-centric design by using easy-to-use platform to manage child support information.
* Adherence to WCAG accessibility standards.
* Meeting the needs of diverse audiences through the various accessibility functionalities.
