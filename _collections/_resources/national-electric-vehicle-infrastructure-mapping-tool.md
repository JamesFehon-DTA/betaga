The [Electric vehicle charging infrastructure](https://evciroadmap.evenergi.com/) (EVCI) mapping tool is an Australian Government initiative developed in collaboration with all states and territories, and EVenergi. This tool delivers on the objectives of the [National electric vehicle strategy](https://www.dcceew.gov.au/energy/transport/national-electric-vehicle-strategy) to guide optimal investment and support improved coordination and planning of charging infrastructure across Australia.

Optimal development zones for fast charging infrastructure are based on projected EV uptake and other key data inputs such as traffic flows and volumes.

To assist in business case development, users can overlay key data such as:

* traffic flows and volumes
* proximity to amenities
* demographics
* route elevation.
