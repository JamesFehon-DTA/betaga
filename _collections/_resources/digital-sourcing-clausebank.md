The Digital Sourcing ClauseBank is a repository of contract and procurement clauses. The pre-drafted terms in the ClauseBank are designed to help agencies create best-practice commercial agreements with sellers, simplifying the process of contract preparation.

The ClauseBank features:

* Reuse Clauses – allowing government buyers to reuse whole solutions or their components, promoting technology sharing across government.
* General Clauses – covering a range of digital sourcing needs, including clauses relevant to whole-of-government arrangements, roles and responsibilities for subject-matter experts (SMEs), and Machinery of Government (MoG) changes.
* Notifications of Significant Events – assisting in the identification, management and mitigation of significant ethical behaviour breaches by sellers.

By utilising pre-drafted clauses available through the ClauseBank, agencies can easily create legally sound and fair contracts that do not impose unfair terms on sellers.
