Responsible agency: **National Disability Insurance Agency**

The my NDIS mobile app provides NDIS participants with an accessible and user-friendly way to:

* view their budget
* view their NDIS plan information and personal details
* make and manage claims.

The app works alongside the myplace portal to help participants quickly, easily and flexibly manage their NDIS plans. It was developed in collaboration with NDIS participants, taking their needs into account and making adjustments based on their feedback to ensure the app was convenient and easy to use.

After it was launched as a pilot in August 2021, people had the opportunity to critique aspects of the app that were cumbersome or overly difficult to use or access.

It was launched in its current form in December 2021, and is now available for the general public to download and use to manage their NDIS plans.
