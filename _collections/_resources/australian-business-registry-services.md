The Australian Business Registry Services (ABRS) is an Australian government agency responsible for administering director identification numbers (director IDs). A director ID is a unique identifier assigned to a director who has verified their identity with the ABRS. This initiative aims to create a fairer business environment by preventing the use of false and fraudulent director identities.

The ABRS provides online services that allow directors to apply for a director ID, as well as manage and update their details. These services are accessible through a secure online platform, ensuring that directors can efficiently comply with regulatory requirements.

In addition to managing director IDs, the ABRS offers helpful links for other business-related registrations. For instance, individuals looking to register a business name can find information on the [Australian Securities and Investments Commission](https://asic.gov.au/for-business/registering-a-business-name/) (ASIC) website. Those needing to apply for an Australian Business Number (ABN) are directed to the [Australian Business Register](https://www.abr.gov.au/business-super-funds-charities/applying-abn) (ABR) website. Furthermore, the [Business Registration Service](https://business.gov.au/registrations/work-out-your-business-registrations) (BRS) website assists individuals in determining the necessary registrations when starting a business.

By consolidating these services, the ABRS aims to streamline business registrations and to ensure the integrity of business information across Australia. This centralised approach facilitates easier access to essential services for business operators and promotes transparency and accountability within the Australian business community.
