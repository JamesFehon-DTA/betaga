## Details

Responsible agency: **Comcare**

Integrated Regulatory Information System (IRIS) is the primary application used by Comcare’s Regulatory Operations Group for various regulatory licensing, monitoring, compliance, and investigation tasks. It is a central, organised, easy-to access place to store data about notifications (work health and safety concerns, hazards and incidents), inspections, information, and associated advice, actions or activities.

IRIS utilises a cloud-based Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system that can be accessed via internet browser. It is built on the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Platform.

IRIS integrates with SharePoint Online for secure storage of documents. The case-related documents are stored in SharePoint and only accessible to the authorised case manager.

It uses Okta identity and access management platform for authentication of Comcare staff and the authorisation leverages Azure Active Directory Security Mapping.

Address validation is achieved by Harmony Address Validation, that is built using custom Power App Control Framework control which consumes the Harmony APIs.
