Direct link: [*hpp.health.gov.au*](https://hpp.health.gov.au/)  
Responsible agency: **Department of Health and Aged Care**

The [Health products portal](https://hpp.health.gov.au/) enables the processes of applying, tracking, paying and managing regulated and reimbursed health related products and services listed on the:

* [Pharmaceutical benefits scheme](https://www.pbs.gov.au/pbs/home) (PBS)
* [Medicare benefits schedule](http://www.mbsonline.gov.au/internet/mbsonline/publishing.nsf/Content/Home) (MBS)
* [Prescribed list](https://www.health.gov.au/our-work/prescribed-list) (PL)
* [National immunisation program](https://www.health.gov.au/health-topics/immunisation/immunisation-throughout-life/national-immunisation-program-schedule) (NIP)

To access the portal, users need to create a digital identity using [myID](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/design/myid) and link it to an organisation using [Relationship authorisation manager](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/design/relationship-authorisation-manager) (RAM). They need to achieve the same identity strength they are authorised for in RAM and to be registered in the *Health products portal* before they can be invited to represent an organisation.
