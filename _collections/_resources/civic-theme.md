Responsible agency: **Salsa Digital**

CivicTheme is an open-source website design system created and maintained by Salsa Digital. It follows the same design principles, accessibility and security standards as the former Australian Government Design System (AGDS) initiated by the Digital Transformation Agency (DTA).

This no-code system is designed to streamline website builds by using pre-built components like hero banners, navigation cards and body content for easy configuration and customisation. Built on Drupal 10, the system includes a theme and component library to support consistent and accessible digital experiences for government websites.

CivicTheme is compliant with government compliance standards, including [WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) and supports mobile accessibility for better user experience.
