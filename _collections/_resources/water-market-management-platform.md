Responsible agency: **Bureau of Meteorology**  
  
Currently, Australian water market information is available through:

* [Bureau of Meteorology (BoM)](http://www.bom.gov.au/water/market/) website, which publishes market reports and operates a water markets dashboard
* [Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) website](https://www.dcceew.gov.au/water/policy/markets), which provides introductory information on water markets.

The Bureau of Meteorology are developing a new national water market system website which will:

* serve as a single digital platform for national water data management
* improve the management and transparency of water markets
* publish minute-by-minute updates on water market information
* ensure standardisation of data provided to the Bureau, to support transparency and enforceability of the new water market regulatory regime.

Find out about the [Water market reforms](https://www.bom.gov.au/water/market/market-reforms.shtml) on the Bureau of Meteorology website.
