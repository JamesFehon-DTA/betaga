The [Relationship authorisation manager](https://info.authorisationmanager.gov.au/) (RAM) is an authorisation service enabling parties to act on behalf of a business online through linkage with a Digital ID.

Parties are required to log in to RAM using their Digital ID and to link their Digital ID, such as MyID to the business’s Australian business number (ABN). How this is done depends on the individual’s role in the business is, ranging from principal authority role down to admin or user roles.

Linking a business to RAM can simplify interactions with government agencies, with easier access to services like tax, grants applications or super contributions.

Relationship Authorisation Manager (RAM) is accredited as an attribute provider under the [Digital ID Accreditation Scheme](https://www.digitalidsystem.gov.au/how-the-system-works#the-voluntary-accreditation-scheme%C2%A0). This includes strict rules and standards for privacy protection, security, usability, accessibility, risk management and fraud control.

By using RAM businesses can benefit from:

* allowing only authorised users to access government online services and transact for the business
* having greater assurance and visibility over who is transacting for their business
* protecting authorised parties’ identity data, as government online service only identifies who is making the transaction for the business, not authorised party’s personal information.
