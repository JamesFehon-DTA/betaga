The Australian Government Digital ID System provides a secure, convenient and voluntary way to verify identity online for accessing government services or sharing sensitive documents, like passports or birth certificates.

AGDIS aligns to the Digital ID Act 2024, as to ensure privacy, security and accessibility are addressed when handling personal information.

The Australian Government Digital ID System is delivered and supported by these Government agencies:

* Department of Finance
* The Office of the System Administrator
* Services Australia
* The Australia Competition and Consumer Commission
* The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner
* The Data Standards Body
* Australian Taxation Office

Some accredited providers are participating in the Australian Government Digital ID System. This means they can be used to access government online services.

The Australian Government Digital ID System includes the Relationship Authorisation Manager (RAM). This enables people to use their Digital ID to act on behalf of a business when accessing participating government services.

There are also many government services who use the system to verify their users.

From December 2024, Commonwealth, state and territory entities can apply to participate in AGDIS, and private businesses can apply from December 2026.
