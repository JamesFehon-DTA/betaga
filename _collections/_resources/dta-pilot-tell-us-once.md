## Details

The DTA Pilot Tell Us Once platform was developed under the Public Service Monetisation Fund (PSMF) from 2017 to 2019 as one of a set of reusable digital platforms (Whole-of-Government Platforms), to help Australian Government agencies provide better services.

The Tell Us Once aim was to create a platform that enabled people to easily tell government agencies once about a change in their personal circumstances, or a life event, with users continuing to control which agencies are updated.

The Tell Us Once platform, and other platforms developed under the PSMF, are now ready for others to take forward. The DTA will not be undertaking any further development for these platforms, and are now sharing to other government agencies the materials developed during the program via our [GitHub open-source code](https://github.com/govau/) repository.
