Dataplace is the digital platform to find and request Australian Government data. The platform brings together those wanting to get access to data (such as researchers and those working on public policy and delivering public services) with Australian Government agencies who are the data custodians. The platform is also used by the National Data Commissioner to regulate the [DATA Scheme](https://www.datacommissioner.gov.au/the-data-scheme).

Dataplace also features the [Australian Government Data Catalogue](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/australian-government-data-catalogue). Together they facilitate users to find, request and use open and restricted data.

Users can use Dataplace to:

* search for data in the Australian Government Data Catalogue
* request data from Australian Government agencies, including under the DATA Scheme
* apply for accreditation to be a data user or data service provider under the DATA Scheme
* develop and manage data sharing agreements using a centralised platform
* monitor and report on your data sharing activities – what data your entity is sharing, with who and for what purpose.

Dataplace is a Microsoft Dynamics Software as a Service (SaaS) solution hosted on an Azure Cloud Tenant. The solution is developed and hosted by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet under the guidance and direction of the Office of the National Data Commissioner. It leverages Microsoft Azure and Office 365 Dynamics offerings and has integrated SurveyJS for easy content development of new web forms.

Dataplace is designed to complement existing systems and processes to support data availability and sharing. Using Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), it is possible to integrate with other internal management systems to automate the management of data available for discovery via the Catalogue and/or workflows for data sharing requests.
