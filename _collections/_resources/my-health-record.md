My Health Record is an online summary of a person’s key health information. Individuals can access and manage their record through myGov, while their healthcare providers view their record either through an integrated clinical information system or the My Health Record National Provider Portal.

Individuals can control what’s stored in their record and who can access it. This includes being able to see when someone has accessed their record.

With a patient’s consent, healthcare providers like doctors, pathologists and pharmacists can upload clinical documents to their record, including:
