The VANguard Federated Authentication Service (FAS) enables government agencies to deploy secure and reliable authentication solutions.

When agencies implement the FAS, their online platforms and services can be accessed by people using their existing login credentials under a single sign-on (SSO) solution. This means they don’t need to create a new password or re-enter their credentials to access these services.

VANguard’s FAS complies with the [Protective Security Classification Framework (PSPF)](https://www.protectivesecurity.gov.au/) and supports authentication to Unclassified, Official and Protected services to ensure the security of government information.

Entities should consider using the FAS if they:

* provide services to businesses
* need visibility of who they interact with
* want to simplify the authentication process for users interacting with government services.
