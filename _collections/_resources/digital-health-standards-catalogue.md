Responsible agency: **Australian Digital Health Agency**

The *Digital health standards catalogue* provides easy access to and simple explanations of the standards that support the ongoing digital transformation of the Australian healthcare sector.

Digital health standards enable different systems and applications to communicate and exchange data securely and reliably across the Australian healthcare system.

This catalogue aims to consolidate all the relevant national and international standards and provide a single source of truth for developers, implementers, and users of digital health solutions. This will help drive more connected and coordinated healthcare in Australia.

The standards catalogue:

* facilitates and strengthens awareness and knowledge of national digital health specifications and standards
* enables healthcare provider organisations to incorporate relevant specifications in their digital health solution procurements
* helps software creators developing or enhancing digital health solutions to easily find technical specifications and standards relevant to national digital health priorities
* ensures consistent, accurate, and reusable health-related data can be easily shared across a connected healthcare system by patients, consumers, families, and clinicians.
