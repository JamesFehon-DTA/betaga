Learnhub provides government agencies with a central catalogue of shared educational content, promoting continuous learning and skills development among Australian Public Service (APS) employees.

The online platform provides APS employees with easy access to eLearning modules, webinars and workshops. It also allows their agencies to monitor and measure their learning and development progress.

Individual agencies can create and share content with other agencies on Learnhub or restrict access to their tenancy and users via single sign-on. Agencies can also access content from a number of third-party providers.
