## Details

NationalMap was decommissioned at the end of June 2025. This decision followed extensive research revealing a gradual decline in usage rates over an extended period. Datasets that were available through NationalMap remain available via [data.gov.au](https://data.gov.au/).

NationalMap, together with [data.gov.au](https://data.gov.au/), was a mechanism in the implementation of Australian Government's [Open Data Policy](https://www.pmc.gov.au/resource-centre/public-data/australian-government-public-data-policy-statement), for open data publication, discovery and consumption by government, industry, research, community organisations and the general public.

NationalMap was an online map-based tool to allow easy access to spatial data from Australian government agencies and was based on a fully open architecture. When you accessed data through it, you were typically accessing the data directly from the government department or agency who are the custodians of that data.

**NationalMap:**

* provided easy access to authoritative and other spatial data to government, business and the public
* facilitated the opening of data by federal, state and local government bodies
* provided an open framework of geospatial data services that support commercial and community innovation.

**Data in the Catalogue**

The datasets in the NationalMap application catalogue were sourced from Commonwealth Government Departments and Agencies, State, Territory and Local Governments and other organisations. Details about each data custodian and their contact details can be found in the catalogue, usually under 'Data Custodian' or 'Description'.

**NationalMap Software**

The core components of NationalMap were Open Source Software (OSS) libraries available as Github projects. The core platform, [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs), is available to assist with the development of other spatial data viewing applications. The platform was initially developed by Data61 for NationalMap, but has subsequently been used for other projects.

**Additional Open Source Software Used**

In developing NationalMap, Data61 has used open source software and contributed back to it. NationalMap leveraged these excellent open source libraries:

* [TerriaJS.](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs)
* [Cesium.](https://cesium.com/platform/cesiumjs)
* [Leaflet.](https://leafletjs.com/)
