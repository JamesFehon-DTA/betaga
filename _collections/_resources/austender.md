AusTender is the Australian Government’s procurement information system. It provides a central location for the publication of business opportunities, annual procurement plans and contracts that have been awarded by government.

AusTender is commonly used to undertake market research. It contains a range of information reports to enable business operators to identify business opportunities and see the types of goods and services that are being provided through existing contracts.

Companies and government entities can also find details of what goods and services the government has procured or is planning to procure. This information is available through automated notifications once you have registered for them.

Entities that use AusTender are required to follow the Commonwealth Procurement Rules, which explain their obligations, and the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act.
