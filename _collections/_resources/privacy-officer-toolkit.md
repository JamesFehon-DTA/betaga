Responsible agency: **Office of the** **Australian Information Commissioner**

The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner has developed a [*Privacy officer toolkit*](https://education.oaic.gov.au/privacy-officer-toolkit/) to help privacy officers to:

* understand and perform their functions under the [*Australian Government agencies privacy code*](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/privacy-registers/privacy-codes-register/australian-government-agencies-privacy-code/)
* navigate the Privacy Act and other relevant legislation to assist their agency and staff members to understand their obligations
* promote privacy best practice within their agency.

The tools and resources contained in the toolkit aim to help agencies maximise opportunities with the data they hold, within a framework that safeguards personal information.

The toolkit contains useful information about:

* role, responsibilities and necessary skills for a Privacy Officer, as defined by section 5 of the Code
* privacy legislative framework, associated requirements and available resources
* collecting and managing data, while safeguarding and protecting personal information (this includes information about de-identification, big data analytics, open data etc.)
* internal and external privacy enquiries, complaints, and requests for access and correction and how to handle them correctly
* requirement for all agencies to have a privacy management plan, as per the Australian Government Agencies Privacy Code
* correctly handling Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA), while minimising or eliminating risks on intruding privacy of individuals
* ensuring privacy policies and notices are clear and transparent about the way they manage personal information
* managing data breaches, by being prepared to take necessary steps to protect personal information from misuse, interference and loss, and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.
