Responsible agency: **Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water**  
  
The [National greenhouse accounts](https://www.greenhouseaccounts.climatechange.gov.au/) is the official source for tracking Australia’s progress towards international emissions reduction commitments and projections estimates for future emissions.

The Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water launched National greenhouse accounts in 2022 to replace the Australian greenhouse emissions information system (AGEIS).

The modernised website includes detailed historical greenhouse gas emissions data since 1990, and emissions projections to 2030.

It focuses on improving the user experience through enhanced data visualisations, while promoting the transparency and availability of the Australian Government’s emissions data. Emissions data can be found through a search function and allows users to create customised data tables and charts to suit their individual needs.

This design enabled improvements for tools such as [Full Carbon Accounting Model](https://www.dcceew.gov.au/climate-change/publications/full-carbon-accounting-model-fullcam) (FullCAM), as well as benefits related to:

* application modernisation, enhancement and cloud uplift
* optimised performance, cost efficiency, and conformance with security and accessibility requirements
* new and expanded datasets for carbon modelling and verification, including more accurate, high-resolution land sector satellite data
* research to support the development and implementation of new carbon models for expanded agricultural and land sector emissions and abatement estimates.
