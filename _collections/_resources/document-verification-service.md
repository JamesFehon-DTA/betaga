The Document Verification Service (DVS) checks whether the biographic information on person’s identity document matches their original record, helping government organisations to securely and efficiently verify identities and confirm details on documents such as birth certificates, driver licences or Medicare cards. The DVS does not check facial images.

The Document Verification Service makes it harder for individuals to use fake identity documents, thus preventing fraud and identity theft.

The Document Verification Service has been operational since 2009, and it is used in both the public and private sector.

The Document Verification Service accesses driver licence information from the National Exchange of Vehicle and Driver Information System (NEVDIS). This is a separate system operated by Austroads Limited on behalf of all states and territories.
