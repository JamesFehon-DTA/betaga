This policy describes the requirements for entities planning digital investments involving quantum computing. Applicability Digital investment proposals are assessed against this policy by the DTA through the Digital and ICT Investment Oversight Framework (IOF) . Commonwealth entities are encouraged to apply this policy to all digital investments.

## Policy requirements

### Comply with legislation

An entity must comply with any legislation relevant to its circumstances.

### Align to best practice and Commonwealth guidelines and standards

Entities must consider and implement according to guidelines, including those applicable to domains within which they are implementing solutions as well as quantum-specific standards.

### Understand the evolving Commonwealth quantum computing technology environment

The Commonwealth development approach must be informed by an understanding of current and emerging quantum computing development policies, practices and owners.

### Leverage quantum opportunities for government

The Commonwealth has a core role to play in enabling Australia’s quantum agenda including enabling basic research; enhancing cybersecurity; and supporting global collaboration. Government is ideally placed to both drive and leverage a range of opportunities.

### Recognise the forecast timeframe for the development of quantum related technology solutions

The Commonwealth solution development approach needs to be informed by both the base quantum computing capabilities available, and the projected timeframe for the development of new technology options.

### Ensure the sustainability of quantum computing solutions

Continual improvement of processes, and features, data, security, technology, skills, and cost should remain a focus to maximise functionality, reduce risk, and minimise accumulation of technical debt.

### Adhere to reuse principles

Entities must analyse the current quantum computing technology environment against their requirements, identifying gaps and opportunities for reuse, give priority to the adoption of reuseable digital and ICT solutions, patterns, or knowledge, and design new solutions with a focus on future reuse.
