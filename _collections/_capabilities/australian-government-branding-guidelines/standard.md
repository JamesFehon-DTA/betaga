Responsible agency: **Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet**  
Last updated: **December 2024**

These guidelines have been developed to help departments and agencies ensure the Australian Government logo is consistently applied to products such as official documents and publications.

The Australian government branding guidelines include rules and guidance in the application of the Australian Government logo in relation to:

* design
* colour
* positioning
* inclusion of other departments / agencies / programs
* stationary logo application
* website logo application
* use of the logo by third parties

## Applicability

Departments and agencies are required to comply with the branding policy unless an exemption, or permission to use a co-branded logo, has been granted by the minister responsible for the branding policy.

Requests for an exemption or a co-branded logo are considered on a case-by-case basis.

## Access the guidelines
