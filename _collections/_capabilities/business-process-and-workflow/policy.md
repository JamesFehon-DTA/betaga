Applicability Digital investment proposals are assessed against this policy by the DTA through the Digital and ICT Investment Oversight Framework (IOF) . Commonwealth entities are encouraged to apply this policy to all digital investments.

## Policy requirements

### Develop a comprehensive understanding of the business and workflow processes targeted for automation

Detailed analysis of agencies’ business processes will help determine the requirements and suitability for automation before starting any technology investigation.

### Check for existing re-useable business process and workflow designs before engaging in new development processes

Utilising existing business process and workflow solutions in public sector services will assist agencies in reducing risk, enhancing consistency, expediting delivery, and lowering costs by adhering to established standards and designs before considering new developments.

### Build for reuse

When reuse is not feasible, agencies must provide evidence of examined government systems, including details on usage, users, scale, and security classification. Additionally, it should be considered how new investments can be adapted for future reuse and able to support agencies with similar requirements.

### Lower development and maintenance complexity of government solutions

Evaluate the suitability of low-code/no-code documented processes and business rules from different channels and systems before developing a standalone, independent applications.

### Understand the existing technology environment

Initiatives using business process and workflow solutions must show how the solution fits within the technological environment, guiding technology decisions and implementation.
