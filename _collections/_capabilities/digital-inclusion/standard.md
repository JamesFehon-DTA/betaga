## About the standard

The [Digital inclusion standard](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/digital-experience/digital-inclusion-standard) establishes specific requirements for designing and delivering inclusive and accessible digital government services through best practice principles, building on the criteria set out by the [Digital service standard](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/digital-experience/digital-service-standard).

## Applicability

Investments that are subject to the [Investment oversight framework (IOF)](https://www.digital.gov.au/investment) and all existing services must meet this standard. Check the [Digital experience policy](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/digital-experience) for details and exemptions.
