This policy describes the requirements for entities planning digital investments and adopting case management systems. Applicability Digital investment proposals are assessed against this policy by the DTA through the Digital and ICT Investment Oversight Framework (IOF) . Commonwealth entities are encouraged to apply this policy to all digital investments.

## Policy requirements

### Understand alignment to case management archetypes

An entity should understand the archetype of their system and use this as a focal point when evaluating similar past investments and in assessing the suitability of a solution.

### Develop a comprehensive understanding of requirements

An entity should analyse its specific needs and define requirements for a case management solution before exploring technology options.

### Check for existing re-useable case management designs before engaging in new development processes

Before developing new solutions, an entity should consider ways to minimise risk, improve consistency, accelerate delivery and reduce overall costs by using existing standards and designs.

### Build for reuse

If reuse isn’t possible, entities should provide evidence of which government systems have been investigated (focusing on system type, users, scale and security classification). Entities should be able to demonstrate that the new investment can be expanded and put into operation for future reuse and to explain how it could benefit other entities in need of similar capability.

### Lower development and maintenance complexity of government solutions

Low-code/no-code documented process and business rules logic that may be invoked across many channels and systems must be considered for suitability prior to programmatically developing a unified software unit that is self-contained and independent from other applications (monolithic).

### Understand the existing technology environment

Initiatives utilising case management solutions must demonstrate engagement and applicability of the solution in the context of the technological environment within which they will operate, informing the technology decision and implementation approach.
