Case management is the process of managing a series of steps or events to reach a resolution. Case management systems help track and manage cases from start to finish. The case management systems normally would include the following functionalities:

* controls on how information is shared and restricted
* processes for auditing and overseeing workflows
* the ability to route cases dynamically based on specific needs
* clear goals and outcomes that are recorded
* proper collection and assignment of information

Because different entities have unique case management needs, a single, centralised system or one-size-fits-all approach is not practical. Each entity must choose, design and implement a solution that fits its specific requirements.

## Understand alignment to case management archetypes

Entities should:

* align their requirements with common government case management archetypes to enable reuse:
  + Contract management
  + Investigation management
  + Service management
  + Human resources management
  + Complaints management
  + Compliance management
  + Claims management.

## Develop a comprehensive understanding of requirements

Entities should:

* ensure that systems meet non-functional requirements including:
  + auditability requirements of cases processes and/or outcomes
  + privacy requirements of individuals, organisations, processes, or intellectual property
  + security needs, particularly if the system contains sensitive or personally identifying data or is otherwise likely a target for threat actors
  + availability/redundancy, especially in the case of systems supporting round-the-clock needs such as medical or emergency services activities.
* consider system scale, assessing:
  + case/data volume: how much data needs to be stored and accessed
  + frequency of case interactions: how often cases are created, updated or retrieved
  + user base size: the number of system users and their access needs
* ensure their case management solution planning considers delivery of the key functional aspects:
  + controls on how information is shared and restricted
  + processes for auditing and overseeing workflows
  + the ability to route cases dynamically based on specific needs
  + clear goals and outcomes that are recorded
  + proper collection and assignment of information

## Check for existing re-useable case management designs before engaging in new development processes

Before developing a new system, entities should:

* explore existing government case management platforms
* investigate whole-of-government arrangements and Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs).

## Build for reuse

If an existing system cannot be reused, entities should:

* provide evidence of evaluations conducted on existing government systems
* demonstrate how the new system will be scalable, reuseable and interoperable with other government platforms.

## Lower development and maintenance complexity of case management solutions

Entities should:

* minimise the need for extensive programming through modular design
* facilitate rapid development and testing of new case management processes
* improve business process understanding and stakeholder satisfaction
* ensure solutions are supportable, affordable, secure and fit for purpose and consider the suitability of low-code/no-code solutions prior to development or adoption of a platform
* review contractual arrangements, MoU currency and AGA designs before selecting a solution.

## Understand the existing technology environment

Entities should:

* assess how their case management needs fit within the broader government digital landscape
* consider cloud adoption, legacy system dependencies, and long-term ICT strategies
* standardise data structures and integration protocols to enhance compatibility and reuse across government
* align technological demands with previous government investments to enable reuse.
