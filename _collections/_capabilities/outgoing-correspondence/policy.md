Applicability Digital investment proposals are assessed against this policy by the DTA through the Digital and ICT Investment Oversight Framework (IOF) . Commonwealth entities are encouraged to apply this policy to all digital investments.

## Policy requirements

### Comply with legislation

An entity must comply with any legislation relevant to its circumstances.

### Motivate digital-first

Encourage users to overcome digital barriers and prioritise communication by correspondence via digital channels wherever possible, simplifying and standardising processes and removing the opportunity for human error.

### Write correspondence that is simple, clear, inclusive, and relevant

Correspondence must be written in conformance with the [Australian Government Style Manual](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/), inclusive, easy to read, and understandable.

### Securely identify and communicate to businesses and individuals

Verify the identities of individuals and businesses prior to sending correspondence, aligning to identity management best practices and policies.

### Apply AI ethics principles and policy when AI is involved in outgoing correspondence

Where AI is utilised at any point during the workflow enabling outgoing correspondence, it must be implemented in line with appropriate policies and guidance.

### Adhere to reuse principles

Entities must give priority to the adoption of reuseable digital and ICT solutions, patterns, or knowledge, and, where necessary, design new solutions with a focus on future reuse.
