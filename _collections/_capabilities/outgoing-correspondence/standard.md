Appropriate process and standardisation of outgoing communication from Commonwealth entities is important to the entities and recipients alike. While current-state technology and solutions have in some ways enhanced the management of outgoing correspondence, considerations detailed in the Standard below will help ensure appropriate and successful correspondence capability implementations across government.

## Comply with legislation and regulation

Entities must:

* comply with relevant Commonwealth legislation including (but not limited to):
  + *Archives Act 1983* (Cth)
  + *Data Availability and Transparency (DAT) Act 2002* (Cth)
  + [*Disability Discrimination Act 1992*](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A04426)(Cth)
  + *Freedom of Information Act 1982* (Cth)
  + *Privacy Act 1988* (Cth)
* comply with any other legislation applicable to specific functions and circumstances.

## Communicate transparently, and proactively

Entities should:

* design systems in a manner that automates immediate correspondence at predefined key points, such as when decisions are made, entitlements are granted, and user input is required
* clearly incorporate all relevant detail in communications
* include appropriate entity contact details within any messaging.

## Motivate digital-first

Entities should:

* communicate the benefits and demonstrate the ease of use for adopting a digital channel
* provide gradual transition options easing users into fully digitised outgoing correspondence services
* prioritise secure digital communication channels above physical media
* digitally generate correspondence in a standardised, systemised, tested manner
* integrate automated correspondence generation with core systems, including (but not limited to) those servicing entitlements, case management, customer relationship management, and any other capability supporting administrative decision making
* where possible, avoid custom integrations of correspondence management tools with other systems, to allow greater maintainability and opportunities for future reuse
* utilise whole-of-government communication channels such as the myGov Inbox unless there is a clear reason not to.

## Write correspondence that is simple, clear, inclusive, and relevant

Entities must:

* adhere to the [Australian Government Style Manual](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/), that sets the criteria for Australian Government writing and editing
* align to applicable principles from the [Digital Experience Policy](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/digital-experience-policy), in particular to design and deliver services that are user-friendly, and inclusive, as well as relevant positions from the [Digital Service Standard](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/digital-service-standard-v2) and [Digital Inclusion Standard](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/digital-inclusion-standard)
* align to the [Australian Government Branding Guidelines](https://www.pmc.gov.au/resources/australian-government-branding-guidelines).

Entities should:

* produce clear, coherent, and inclusive correspondence that serves the users' needs
* define internal, entity-wide mandatory standards, and associated templates, to ensure consistency between different outputs and channels
* ensure human-centred design practices are applied when writing and managing outbound correspondence
* ensure cohesion between digital channels and outgoing correspondence
* ensure that digital communications are validated as being able to be read/interfaced with by accessible technologies.

## Securely identify and communicate to businesses and individuals

Government correspondence may contain sensitive data, and the risk of inadvertent access or damage must be managed. Entities must:

* identity-verify individuals prior to sending of correspondence through an identity system
* ensure that each stage of the communication chain, between sender and recipient, meets legislative requirements and security standards such as the [Protective Security Policy Framework](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/protective-security-policy-framework-pspf).

Entities should:

* utilise an identity system to determine trust between individuals, organisations, services, and devices
* utilise the [Trusted Digital Identity Framework](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/trusted-digital-identity-framework-tdif-0) Identity Exchange and Attribute Provider to enable identity authentication
* avoid communicating information that could cause the recipient to behave in a way that might be exploited by threat actors.

## Apply AI ethics principles and policy when AI is involved in outgoing correspondence

Entities must:

* comply with the [Policy for responsible use of AI in government](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/responsible-use-of-AI-in-government) where there is AI involved at any point in outgoing correspondence.

Entities should:

* consider opportunities to utilise emerging technologies, such as AI, to speed up the correspondence of critical information to individuals and business
* apply [Australia’s 8 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Ethics Principles](https://www.industry.gov.au/publications/australias-artificial-intelligence-ethics-framework/australias-ai-ethics-principles) when curating and sending outgoing correspondences for people and businesses using AI
* ensure AI inclusions are developed and used in a way that provides benefits while minimising the risk of negative impact to people, groups, and wider society
* transparently identify where and how AI has been utilised at any point of an outgoing correspondence chain.

## Adhere to reuse principles

The Australian Government Architecture provides information for entities on [Reuse](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/reuse-standard).

Entities should:

* where possible use the myGov Inbox for outbound correspondence
* consider outgoing correspondence-specific functional and non-functional requirements prior to solution design or consideration of technology choice, including:
  + existing technology landscape, and integration complexity
  + volume and nature of correspondence
  + broader system purpose
  + performance and availability requirements
  + privacy/sensitivity concerns
* meet the requirements of the [Digital and ICT Reuse Policy](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/digital-and-ict-reuse-policy).
