## About the standard

The [Digital service standard](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/digital-experience/digital-service-standard) sets the requirements for designing and delivering digital government services.

It guides digital teams to create and maintain digital services that are:

* user-friendly
* inclusive
* adaptable
* measurable.

## Applicability

Investments that are subject to the [Investment oversight framework (IOF)](https://www.digital.gov.au/investment) and all existing services must meet this standard. Check the [Digital experience policy](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/digital-experience) for details and exemptions.
