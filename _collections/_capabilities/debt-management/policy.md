This policy describes the requirements for entities planning digital investments involving the management of debt. Applicability Digital investment proposals are assessed against this policy by the DTA through the Digital and ICT Investment Oversight Framework (IOF) . Commonwealth entities are encouraged to apply this policy to all digital investments.

## Policy requirements

### Comply with legislation

An entity must comply with legislation relevant to its circumstances.

### Align operational and technological needs

Proactive determination of business requirements and an understanding of the technological landscape enables the deployment of debt management solutions and measures that align to operational and technological needs.

### Undertake responsible debt collection

Appropriate system selection and deployment will ensure any debt recovery action is ethical, proportionate, consistent, and transparent.

### Proactively mitigate financial risks

Incidence of debt can be minimised through utilisation of strong forecasting and financial oversight tools, where possible stopping debts arising and avoiding the need for debt management entirely. Establishment of a continuous feedback loop where insights from debt recovery activities are systematically fed back into their financial management processes to further refine and strengthen preventive measures.

### Monitor for debtor and entity human risks

Monitoring of debt management systems will assist to ensure that any patterns of bias or unintended consequences are quickly identified and addressed.

### Adhere to reuse principles

Entities must give priority to the adoption of reuseable digital and ICT solutions, patterns, or knowledge, and, where necessary, design new solutions with a focus on future reuse.

### Identify needs and approach in advance of selecting HPC facilities

Plan and design systems which require HPC facilities using a coherent Enterprise Architecture approach, clearly setting out at both the solution architecture level and the broader enterprise architecture level how use of HPC meets business needs while representing the most cost-effective, fit-for-purpose, and risk-balanced solution approach.

### Access HPC resources utilising shared facilities available to the APS

Prioritise the utilisation of Australian Government owned and operated facilities, Australian Government funded research facilities, and Australian Whole-of-Government procurement contract arrangements and other appropriate procurement arrangements with industry. Value for money in facilities should be balanced with additional factors as set out in the Standard.

### Align to guidelines and standards

All Commonwealth entities must comply with the [Hosting Certification Framework](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/hosting-certification-framework) to ensure cloud-oriented HPC services are hosted in certified tenancies/data centres, as well as any other mandatory frameworks, policies, and standards.

### Adhere to reuse principles

Entities must give priority to the utilisation of suitable existing HPC facilities and, where necessary, design new solutions with a focus on future reuse.
