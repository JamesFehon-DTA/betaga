The framework aims to provide Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people greater agency over how their data are governed within the Australian Public Service (APS) so government held data better reflects their priorities and aspirations.

The framework puts Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples at its centre. It recognises better outcomes are achieved if Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have a genuine say in matters affecting them, including use of data to inform policymaking in government.

## Access the framework

The niaa.gov.au website hosts the [*Framework for the governance of Indigenous data*](https://www.niaa.gov.au/resource-centre/framework-governance-indigenous-data) (full text).

## Framework guidelines

The framework guides the APS on how to build strong governance over Indigenous data holdings held by the Commonwealth by instructions grouped into the following guidelines:

1. **Partner with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people** – partner with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people at all stages of the data lifecycle to ensure their priorities are reflected in data about their communities.
2. **Build data-related capabilities** – improve the capabilities of APS staff and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander partners relating to Indigenous data across the data lifecycle.
3. **Provide knowledge of data assets** – develop straightforward methods for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to know what data are held relating to their interests, its use, and how it can be accessed.
4. **Build an inclusive data system** – build towards organisational and cultural change within the APS to support the inclusion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in data governance.
