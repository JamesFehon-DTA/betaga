The *Digital sourcing framework* is a set of principles, policies and guidance for government agencies buying digital products and services.

The framework promotes best practices to help agencies create a competitive and fair environment for digital sourcing and ensures procurement processes are transparent, efficient and effective.

## Applicability

The *Digital sourcing framework* applies to non-corporate Commonwealth entities, as defined by the [*Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013*](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2014C00317), and may be leveraged by other Commonwealth entities and companies.

## Access the framework

The buyict.gov.au website hosts the [*Digital sourcing framework*](https://www.buyict.gov.au/sp?id=policy) (full text).

## Framework principles

Agencies should follow the best-practice principles below when sourcing digital products and services:

* encourage competition
* innovate and iterate often
* enable small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to compete fairly
* reuse components of other similar ICT projects
* be outcome-focused
* use open standards and cloud first
* minimise cyber-security risks
* avoid duplication by not building platforms other agencies have already built.
