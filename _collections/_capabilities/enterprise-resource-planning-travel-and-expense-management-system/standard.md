A Travel and Expense System supports Travel and Expense Management (TEMS) capability in allowing the Australian Public Sector (APS) to streamline, automate, and effectively manage the complexities associated with travel planning, expense reimbursement, relocation, and financial tracking.

TEMS capability refers to the software and systems designed to manage and optimise the travel and expense management aspects of operating in the Australian Government’s ERP environment. It integrates with several travel and credit related provider systems, to enable APS staff to manage budgets and expenditure related to local and domestic travel and miscellaneous expenses.

TEMS integrates functionalities for:

* **Travel Booking and Authorisation:** Centralised planning and booking with adherence to policies and budget constraints.
* **Expense Management:** Structured submission, validation, approval, and reimbursement, reducing errors and overhead.
* **Policy Compliance:** Enforcing adherence to government regulations and transparency requirements.
* **Audit and Reporting:** Robust tracking and analysis of expenses, ensuring transparency and accountability.
* **Integration with Financial Systems:** Facilitating accurate accounting and budgeting.
* **Mobile Accessibility:** Enabling convenient management of travel plans and expenses.

This standard is limited to the TEMS sub-capability, and should be viewed within the context of the overarching [Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Standard](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/enterprise-resource-planning-standard), and alongside those aligned to the other defined ERP value streams:

* [ERP Finance Standard](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/erp-finance-standard)
* [ERP Human Capital Management (HCM) Standard](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/erp-human-capital-management-standard)
* [ERP Procurement Standard](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/erp-procurement-standard)

Travel and Expense Management (TEMS) capability can be implemented through several commercial platform solutions. These platforms may be discovered in multiple ways such as: BuyICT; whole of Australian-Government contracts; and entity implemented solutions underpinned by platforms.

Efficient TEMS capability is crucial for Commonwealth entities, optimising travel planning, expense management, and reimbursement processes. Through automation and policy enforcement, it boosts operational efficiency, transparency, and oversight. Real-time spending insights empower informed decision-making, supported by rigorous audit trails ensuring compliance and accountability. Ultimately, it fosters cost-effectiveness and resource optimisation.

This capability plays a pivotal role in delivering functionality and value for Commonwealth entities by providing a tailored suite of tools and processes, including:

* **Efficiency and Streamlining:** Automating travel planning, booking, expense submission, and reimbursement processes reduces manual effort and enhances overall productivity.
* **Policy Adherence and Compliance:** Embedding government regulations and policies into workflows ensures transparency and accountability in spending.
* **Real-time Visibility and Control:** Integration with financial systems provides insights into spending data, facilitating informed decision-making and budget utilisation.
* **Accuracy and Auditability:** Automated validation processes minimise errors and fraudulent activities, while robust audit trails ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.
* **Cost Savings and Optimisation:** Streamlined processes and policy enforcement identify opportunities for cost savings and optimisation, maximising value for taxpayers.

## Standard statements

Entities should:

* ensure their ERP TEMS solution delivers capabilities as specified and defined below
* document their implementation in a way that maps modules to the capabilities and processes specified in this standard, enabling traceability and future reuse.
