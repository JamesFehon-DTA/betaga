The Australian Government ensures the safety and security of its operations to remain a trusted custodian of sensitive information. This standard is designed to ensure that personal information of individuals is handled in a manner that is consistent with legislative and regulatory frameworks. This helps enhance trust in government, promote transparency, and foster a culture of privacy awareness.

It is critical this standard be considered alongside those of related capabilities:

* Application Security
* Information Asset Security
* Network Security
* Permissions

## Comply with legislation

Entities must:

* comply with relevant Commonwealth legislation including (but not limited to):
  + *Privacy Act 1988* (Cth)
  + *Archives Act 1983* (Cth)
  + *Freedom of Information Act 1982* (Cth)
* adhere to the principles-based law of the [Australian Privacy Principles (APPs)](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/australian-privacy-principles)
* comply with any other legislation applicable to specific functions and circumstances.

Entities should:

* utilise the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) [APP guidelines](https://www.oaic.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/1125/app-guidelines-july-2019.pdf) to assist in applying the APPs
* seek independent legal advice where appropriate.

## Align to guidelines and standards

Entities must:

* apply the principles and requirements of the [Protective Security Policy Framework](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/protective-security-policy-framework-pspf) throughout their organisation.

Entities should:

* participate in the [Australian Government Digital Identity System](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/mygovid)
* meet the requirements set out in the [Trusted Digital Identity Framework](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/trusted-digital-identity-framework-tdif-0)
* apply a risk-based approach to privacy to align with the [Information Security Manual](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/ism) (ISM)
* be aware of, and apply, other standards relevant to their operating context.

## Be private-by-design

Entities should:

* embed privacy practices into the design and implementation of solutions
* develop and maintain robust governance and reporting
* ensure protocols, procedures, and technology solutions adapt to changing privacy laws, technologies, opportunities, and threats
* foster a culture of privacy awareness through training and governance
* follow OAIC’s [Privacy by Design](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/privacy-guidance-for-organisations-and-government-agencies/privacy-impact-assessments/privacy-by-design) guidance.

## Take a proactive approach to privacy risks and incident responses

Entities must:

* undertake a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) for all high privacy risk projects
* periodically review PIAs to reflect changes in technology and data usage
* implement mechanisms to detect, report, and respond to data breaches in line with the [Notifiable Data Breaches (NDB) scheme](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/notifiable-data-breaches/about-the-notifiable-data-breaches-scheme).

Entities should:

* conduct PIAs even when not mandatory, to understand privacy impacts
* use [the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner’s (OAIC’s) PIA guide](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/privacy-guidance-for-organisations-and-government-agencies/privacy-impact-assessments/guide-to-undertaking-privacy-impact-assessments) to tailor the PIA process to specific business needs
* choose technology solutions with advanced monitoring and alerting capabilities
* use the [OAIC’s data breach preparation and response](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/privacy-guidance-for-organisations-and-government-agencies/preventing-preparing-for-and-responding-to-data-breaches/data-breach-preparation-and-response) guide to prepare for, and respond to, a data breach.

## Adhere to reuse principles

The Australian Government Architecture provides information for entities on [Reuse](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/reuse-standard).

Entities should:

* compare their requirements with those of other comparable entities and system functions, and seek to reuse learnings from preceding implementations
* consider specific functional and non-functional requirements prior to solution design or consideration of technology choice, including:
  + volume and nature of information assets
  + broader system purpose
  + performance and availability requirements
  + privacy/sensitivity concerns
* meet the requirements of the [Digital and ICT Reuse Policy](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/digital-and-ict-reuse-policy).
