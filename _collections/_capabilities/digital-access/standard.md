## About the standard

The [Digital access standard](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/digital-experience/digital-access-standard) sets criteria for agencies to reduce duplication of entry points, supporting unified access to digital government services for people and business.

It helps agencies consider consolidating access points by either incorporating a new service into an existing platform or creating a new access point and migrating other existing access points into it.

## Applicability

Investments that are subject to the [Investment oversight framework (IOF)](https://www.digital.gov.au/investment) must meet this standard. Check the [Digital experience policy](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/digital-experience) for details and exemptions.
