The *Whole-of-government brand architecture* was a set of branding guidelines, stating that all Australian Government departments and agencies were required to use common branding on their websites and print publications. Agencies were expected to develop all branding with reference to, and consistent with, the *Whole-of-government brand architecture* document as endorsed by the Secretaries Digital Committee on 7 February 2022.

## Applicability

The *Whole-of-government brand architecture* has been superseded by the [*Australian Government branding guidelines*](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/australian-government-branding-guidelines-0), maintained by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.
