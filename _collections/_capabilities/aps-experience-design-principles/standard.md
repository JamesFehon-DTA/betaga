The APS Experience Design Principles support the Australian Public Service to design and deliver people-centric and inclusive policies and services.

They provide guidance for embedding human-centred design approaches into the creation of new services and the improvement of existing ones – elevating the experience for government customers, staff, businesses and third-party partners. The principles apply across all channels, whether people are interacting with government and its services online, on the phone or in person.

When working on a policy, program, or behind the scenes, the principles can be applied at every stage of the process – from development to design and implementation.

The principles are evidence-based, developed through extensive consultation, user research and review of best practice.

Together, the seven principles support the APS to ‘put people and business at the centre of policy and services’. They do this by encouraging:

* a good understanding of people’s needs early in the program/project lifecycle
* consistent consideration of customer and staff experiences
* streamlined service delivery across government.

The principles are designed to work hand in hand with the [Digital Service Standard](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/digital-experience/digital-service-standard), within the [Digital Experience Policy](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/digital-experience).

They were developed as part of the [APS Reform Agenda](https://www.apsreform.gov.au/) to deliver better outcomes for the community and contribute to a fairer, more inclusive Australia. They also build on the [APS Vision for User-Centred Service Excellence](https://www.apsreform.gov.au/news/aps-vision-user-centred-service-excellence): ‘Reliable and accessible services, when and how you need them’.

## Applicability

The APS Experience Design Principles were developed by Services Australia and the Australian Public Service Commission for use across the public service.

They are endorsed by the executive [Partnership Priorities Committee](https://www.dss.gov.au/committees/resource/partnership-priorities-committee-communique-5-september-2024) for use by non-corporate Commonwealth entities. They apply to both new and existing services for staff and the public.

## The principles

### Simple

**Outcomes**

* People find information and communication clear, easy to understand and actionable.
* Services and support are easy to access.
* Tasks and processes are intuitive and easy to complete.

When we make things easier, we reduce the time and effort it takes for people to get things done.

By making sure information and services are easy to access and follow, we reduce the chance of errors without causing unnecessary confusion or frustration. Simple services create better outcomes for everyone.

**Design criteria**

* Easy to use: We ensure people can easily access and use services when they need to.
* Clear: We design content and communication that's easy to find, understand and action.
* Efficient: We ensure people can complete tasks with minimum effort or intervention.

### Inclusive

**Outcomes**

* People have equitable access to all parts of our services in ways that meet their needs based on their circumstances.
* People understand their options and feel empowered to make decisions based on their needs.

People have different lived experiences, abilities and needs. By recognising and appreciating diversity and designing with empathy, we can ensure that policies and services meet the needs of our diverse population.

**Design criteria**

* Accessibility: We design services that are accessible to people with diverse needs and circumstances.
* Diversity: We listen, empathise and adapt to the needs of the diverse range of people that interact with us.
* Equity: We design our policies and services to ensure everyone has the same opportunity for success.

### Tailored

**Outcomes**

* People are provided relevant information and support at the right time in a way they prefer.
* People have choice in their interactions based on their preferences.
* Needs are pre-empted and proactively met.

We empower people to personalise their interactions based on their needs and preferences. We aim to anticipate people's needs before they reach out to us, providing them with relevant information and support. By tailoring our services and approaches we can cater to everyone – from the most tech-savvy and light-touch users to those needing a more supported experience. This principle shifts government service delivery to become more proactive.

**Design criteria**

* Personalised: We provide people options to personalise their interactions with us based on their preferences.
* Proactive: We proactively offer relevant information and support.

### Connected

**Outcomes**

* People have a connected and consistent experience across channels and government services.
* People have a coordinated and clear pathway to achieve their goals.

We can create a connected experience by giving holistic advice and support, sharing data and integrating different services, increasing efficiency and reducing effort and red tape, so customers only need to tell their story once. Services that work effortlessly across channels and governments simplify and transform interaction with government, leading to increased satisfaction.

**Design criteria**

* Consistent: We ensure consistency in the way we design and deliver services across government.
* Interoperable: We take a holistic approach and connect government services and channels to make it easier for people to access the support they need.
* Partnerships: We partner with relevant stakeholders to co-design services.

### Transparent

**Outcomes**

* People understand how and why decisions are reached.
* The experience is predictable and clear, so people know what to expect, why and how.
* Information about how data is used and collected is clear.

Transparency in government is crucial. It creates certainty, reduces confusion and ambiguity, and builds trust. Be clear about how and why information and data are collected, used and shared. We tell people how and why decisions have been made and help them make sense of how it all works.

**Design criteria**

* Use of data: We clearly communicate how data is collected and used. We provide people with visibility and control over their data.
* Decision-making: We explain how and why outcomes and decisions are reached, and ensure people understand their options and next steps.
* Clear expectations: We are clear about reciprocal obligations and expectations. We give people accurate, up-to-date information about processes and timeframes.

### Safe

**Outcomes**

* People need to feel safe and be safe. Steps are taken to prevent or reduce the risk of harm to people.
* This includes reducing risks to their physical, psychological, cultural and cyber safety.

We're committed to creating an environment where people feel protected, respected and secure - physically, psychologically and culturally. We instil confidence that people’s information is secure.

**Design criteria**

* Information privacy: We take all reasonable steps to protect people’s personal information and ensure it remains confidential.
* Do no harm: We are committed to providing people an environment in which they feel safe. We prevent or reduce issues that threaten their safety.

### Trustworthy

**Outcomes**

* People are confident that they can rely on our services and that their needs will be responded to in a timely manner.
* People trust that processes and decisions are lawful, fair and equitable.

We strive to be consistently reliable and responsive to people's needs, giving them confidence in us and our services. We act with integrity and are committed to making our processes and decisions lawful, fair and equitable for everyone. Applying the other six principles plays a big role in building public trust.

**Design criteria**

* Reliable: We provide timely and accurate support to people when they need it.
* Capable staff: We ensure our staff have the necessary skills and tools to effectively deliver quality services.
* Accountable: We deliver services promised, while adhering to commonly accepted ethical standards and values.
